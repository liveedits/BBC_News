                            Anthony Mancinelli sits in a salon chair in New Windsor, New York, waiting for his next customer. Aged 107, Mancinelli is used to the routine: he has been cutting hair for 96 years.Among his many customers is Chris Dunne, who has been a decade-long client at Fantastic Cuts, where Mancinelli has been employed for the last four years.“He’s the only that does a really mean flat top. No offense to the other haircutters,” says Dunne.A love for his craft keeps this centenarian at work. “I got to keep going and it seems to keep me younger,” says Mancinelli, who first picked up a pair of hair clippers aged 11. “I can't stay home doing nothing.”To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called "If You Only Read 6 Things This Week".
