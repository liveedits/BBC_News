                A state ‘maternity hotel’ programme in Denmark enables babies to receive the same care during their first days, regardless of class.

                            In Denmark, a state programme enables mothers access to two days of care to get their new-born babies healthy and ready for life. All mothers, regardless of income or social status, have access to the care to give their children an equal start to their first days.The public programme is among Denmark’s generous public childcare policies; new parents are offered a combined 52 weeks of leave, during which a mother is guaranteed 18 weeks at full pay.People in other countries who don’t have money to get access to childbirth care might not be able to offer their children “the same possibilities or the best start in life”, says Sara Vang Ipsen, who recently gave birth to her first child, a baby boy, in Copenhagen’s Hvidovre Hospital. “It would kind of divide society, whereas here it is for everybody.”To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called "If You Only Read 6 Things This Week".
