Who was George HW Bush?Bush Sr's single presidential term in office was dominated by foreign policy - the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. With the end of communism, Bush declared at his inauguration: "A new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn." Bush was instrumental in building the international military coalition that forced Iraq's Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. He became president after serving two terms as vice-president to Ronald Reagan - the first since 1836 to be elected from there into the top job.But despite achieving popularity ratings of 90%, Bush was accused of neglecting domestic affairs and was defeated by Bill Clinton in the 1992 election. His famous 1988 campaign promise - "Read my lips. No new taxes" - came back to haunt him when he felt compelled to reverse policy.
