            Mr Hegarty's former partner Charley Johnson said tributes, which had been left to commemorate Mr Hegarty's life, had been moved and a wooden board was propped close to his gravestone.She said there had been "no apology" at the time and "no explanation" as to why it had happened."It shouldn't have happened in the first place," she said. "[Daniel's] mother saw it first and no son should see [his father's grave] like that."
