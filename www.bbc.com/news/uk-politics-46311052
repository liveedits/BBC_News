            Could there be a second Brexit vote?
            The Prime Minister has ruled out holding another referendum on Brexit, but some people still want the UK to stay in the EU and others want a final say on the deal to leave.  So could there be another vote?  Our political correspondent Nick Eardley looks at what might happen.If a further referendum was to happen, the EU would have to agree to delay or cancel the Article 50 deadline of the UK leaving the EU on 29 March 2019; in the UK, politicians would also have to pass legislation for a new referendum.Filmed and edited by Nick Raikes
