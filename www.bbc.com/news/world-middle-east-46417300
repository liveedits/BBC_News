In a statement on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu said: "These recommendations were determined and leaked even before the investigations began.
    
        
"I'm sure that in this case the relevant authorities, after examining the issue, will reach the same conclusion: that there was nothing because there is nothing."In February, police recommended indicting Mr Netanyahu in two other corruption investigations.He had dismissed all the allegations as "baseless".Israeli media say Mr Netanyahu has been questioned by investigators a number of times.The prime minister, 69, heads a fragile coalition, but he appears confident the allegations will not spur early elections.The next legislative poll is scheduled for November 2019. Mr Netanyahu is in his second stint as prime minister.
