            A plane carrying 127 people skidded and fell on its side on a runway at an airport in Bolivia after it appeared to collapse onto its landing gear.The Peruvian Airlines Boeing 737 was landing at El Alto airport, west of the capital La Paz, after arriving from Cuzco on Thursday. None of the 122 passengers or five crew members were hurt, officials said.The incident, which occurred at about 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT), forced the airport to close for several hours.
