            What's the background?The white supremacist rally was one of the largest such gatherings in America in decades.Dozens were injured in the violence that erupted between white nationalists and counter-protesters.The "Unite the Right" march was organised to protest against plans to remove a statue of a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War.Graphic video of the incident involving Mr Fields's car was widely shared on social media.The rise of the alt-right
Are US right-wing groups on the rise?
What did the jury hear?Prosecutor Nina Antony said that photographic and video evidence would show that Mr Fields's actions were pre-meditated and not motivated by self-protection, as the defence would argue.She said that months before the incident, the reputed far-right sympathiser had posted pictures on Instagram showing a group of people being struck by a car."On August 12, James Alex Fields Jr was here in Charlottesville with anger and images of violence fixed in his mind. The case is about his decision to act on that anger and those images," she said.
