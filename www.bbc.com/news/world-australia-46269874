            For more than 40 years, Sisto Malaspina served up coffee, cake and smiles to the countless people who entered his famous cafe in the heart of Melbourne.But earlier this month, while on an afternoon break, Mr Malaspina was murdered in a terror attack about 400m (1,300 feet) from his cafe.The 74-year-old was stabbed alongside two men who suffered injuries but survived. The attacker was shot dead by police.On Tuesday, Mr Malaspina's customers were among hundreds of people who gathered to remember him at a state funeral in Australia's largest church.It follows much public grief - and a vast number of tributes - for the popular co-owner of Pellegrini's, one of Melbourne's best-known cafes.

        Many tributes have referred to Mr Malaspina's kindness, sense of humour and even his "out-there" fashion. Outside his cafe, customers queued to lay flowers and sign a condolence book. There have also been calls to rename an adjoining laneway in his honour.'An Australian story'Speaking at his funeral, Governor of Victoria Linda Dessau said she recalled her own childhood visits to Pellegrini's for cake and Italian food.Ms Dessau said Mr Malaspina had put in "incredible hard work" and 70-hour weeks to ensure he prospered after migrating. He also built a sense of community, she added."Sisto Malaspina's story is an Australian story," she said.
