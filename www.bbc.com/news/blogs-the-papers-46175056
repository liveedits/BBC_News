                    A soldier wearing World War One uniform bows his head in silence at St George's Hall in Liverpool, as the Times devotes a two-page wraparound image to the Armistice centenary. The other half of the photograph is overlaid with words from Laurence Binyon's poem, For The Fallen.

                    The Daily Mail combines its commemoration of those who died 100 years ago with a contemporary plea. "Treat TODAY'S heroes with the dignity they deserve," the paper says. Images of the Queen, the Duchess of Sussex and the Duchess of Cambridge with their eyes closed in prayer accompany the story.

                    "Never forget," says Metro, under the dates 1918-2018. The paper has published a two-page wraparound image of the Cenotaph in Whitehall, where hundreds of poppy wreaths left by members of the public stretch out along the road.

                    "For your tomorrow, they gave their today," says the Daily Mirror. A full-page photograph shows a uniformed veteran and a young girl reading the names on the Armed Forces Memorial in Alrewas, Staffordshire.

                    Photographs of the Queen, the Duchess of Sussex and the Duchess of Cambridge lead the Daily Express's Armistice coverage. Their eyes are closed "in silent prayer", as the headline puts it.

                    A striking image takes up half of the Daily Telegraph front page. At a sandy cove in Cornwall, the waves roll in towards a beach portrait of Lieutenant Richard Charles Graves-Sawle, killed at the Battle of Ypres. "Their past is our future," the paper says. The main story features former foreign secretary Boris Johnson calling for a cabinet "mutiny" over the Prime Minister's Brexit plans.

                    "A century on, millions unite in gratitude," says the Guardian, next to an image of Chelsea pensioners in brilliant sunshine. Beneath that is a story saying police chiefs are trying to scrap the requirement for "reasonable grounds" to stop and search someone.

                    The Financial Times front page covers the Armistice anniversary from France. It says President Emmanuel Macron criticised rising nationalism, in what the paper sees as a "rebuke" to US President Donald Trump.

                    Macron's warning about nationalism also sets the tone for the i's front page, under the headline "Let us choose peace". It also says the scale of remembrance this year was "unprecedented".

                    The Armistice is represented on the front page of the Sun with images of the Royal Family at the commemorations. The main story says a mother and daughter have been forced to live in a hospital room for 15 months while waiting for a council home. "National Hotel Service," as the headline puts it.

                    Photographs of the Royal Family at prayer also mark the Armistice in the Daily Star. Its main story previews Coronation Street's Christmas storylines, with producers promising "big heartbreaking stories" and "a huge shock" alongside lighter moments.
