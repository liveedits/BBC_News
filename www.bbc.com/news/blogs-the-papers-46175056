                    A soldier wearing World War One uniform bows his head in silence at St George's Hall in Liverpool, as the Times devotes a two-page wraparound image to the Armistice centenary. The other half of the photograph is overlaid with words from Laurence Binyon's poem, For The Fallen.

                    The Daily Mail combines its commemoration of those who died 100 years ago with a contemporary plea. "Treat TODAY'S heroes with the dignity they deserve," the paper says. Images of the Queen, the Duchess of Sussex and the Duchess of Cambridge in prayer accompany the story.

                    "Never forget," says Metro, under the dates 1918-2018. The paper has published a two-page wraparound image of the Cenotaph in Whitehall, where hundreds of poppy wreaths left by members of the public stretch out along the road.

                    "For your tomorrow, they gave their today," says the Daily Mirror. A full-page photograph shows a uniformed veteran and a young girl reading the names on the Armed Forces Memorial in Alrewas, Staffordshire.

                    Photographs of the Queen, the Duchess of Sussex and the Duchess of Cambridge lead the Daily Express's Armistice coverage. Their eyes are closed "in silent prayer", as the headline puts it.

                    A striking image takes up half of the Daily Telegraph front page. At a sandy cove in Cornwall, the waves roll in towards a beach portrait of Lieutenant Richard Charles Graves-Sawle, killed at the Battle of Ypres. "Their past is our future," the paper says. The main story features former foreign secretary Boris Johnson calling for a cabinet "mutiny" over the prime minister's Brexit plans.

                    "A century on, millions unite in gratitude," says the Guardian, next to an image of Chelsea pensioners in brilliant sunshine. Beneath that is a story saying police chiefs are trying to scrap the requirement for "reasonable grounds" to stop and search someone.

                    The Financial Times front page covers the Armistice anniversary from France. It says President Emmanuel Macron criticised rising nationalism, in what the paper sees as a "rebuke" to US President Donald Trump.

                    Macron's warning about nationalism also sets the tone for the i's front page, under the headline "Let us choose peace". It also says the scale of remembrance this year was "unprecedented".

                    The Armistice is represented on the front page of the Sun with images of the Royal Family at the commemorations. The main story says a mother and daughter have been forced to live in a hospital room for 15 months while waiting for a council home. "National Hotel Service," as the headline puts it.

                    Photographs of the Royal Family at prayer also mark the Armistice in the Daily Star. Its main story previews Coronation Street's Christmas storylines, with producers promising "big heartbreaking stories" and "a huge shock" alongside lighter moments.
                
            "Forty-eight hours to sort Brexit," runs a headline in the Daily Mail, which warns that Theresa May has until tomorrow night to break the deadlock, or she'll be forced to spend billions of pounds on preparations for a possible "no deal". The Sun agrees "crunch time" is fast approaching. The paper's columnist, Trevor Kavanagh, likens the situation to a plane, in which Remainers and Brexiteers are going down together, while the pilot - the prime minister - steers the country towards "abject humiliation".

        "Barring a bold last-minute swerve, we are all doomed," he adds.In an interview with the Politico website, the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, suggests a second Brexit referendum. The Guardian's Matthew d'Ancona agrees that the logic points to an extension of Article 50 and a so-called People's Vote, but he says that much more probable is a political collapse in which Mrs May is ousted.But calls for another referendum are dismissed by the Daily Express as a "recipe for more chaos and division". What is needed from the government, it says, is more resolve.

        "In silent prayer" is the main headline in the Express, which devotes its front page to a photograph of the Queen - eyes closed and deep in thought - leading the nation's tribute to British servicemen killed in World War One. On the front page of the Daily Mirror, a photograph shows a veteran clasping a child, as the pair read names on a war memorial. "For your tomorrow, they gave their today," the headline says.The Times describes the presence of the German president at the Armistice centenary commemorations in London as a historic act of reconciliation. It showed how much "the rancour and sorrow of war" had given way to "the balm of peace".The Financial Times leads with Emmanuel Macron's attack on nationalism as a "betrayal of patriotism", describing it as an implicit "Armistice Day rebuke" to President Trump. The paper says the architect of "America First" politics cut a sometimes isolated figure during his visit to France. The Guardian reports that police chiefs want to trigger an expansion of stop and search by lowering the level of suspicion an officer needs to use the controversial power. It says senior officers have recently held talks with Home Office advisers to discuss the issue. The Sun says the possible change follows a crime surge which has seen at least 250 people killed by knives this year.

                    England's Amy Wilson Hardy is helping unemployed women grab job opportunities
                
            Finally, the Mail has news of an unusual scheme to boost the confidence of the unemployed: jobless women are receiving intensive rugby training from an England player. The project, part-funded by the government, is being pioneered by a job centre in south-west London. One participant says the twice-weekly sessions on cold and muddy fields have made her stronger inside: "I feel like Rambo!"A cartoon in the paper shows a male human resources manager being rugby-tackled to the ground by a determined woman as he interviews her for a job. "Very good," he gasps. "Now let's move on from your practical skills..."
