        Police in New Zealand investigating the murder of British backpacker Grace Millane have found a body on the outskirts of Auckland.Det Insp Scott Beard said the body was "believed to be Grace" but was yet to be formally identified.A 26-year-old man currently being held by police has been charged with killing Miss Millane, 22, from Essex.Det Insp Beard said the body was found "about 10 metres" off Scenic Drive, a countryside road outside the city.He added it was an "unbearable time for the Millane family and our hearts go out to them".
    
        
"Any father, any parent in this situation will struggle," Det Insp Beard said. "We're putting a lot of support around him [Grace's father]. It's difficult because he's here with a brother from England and the rest of the family are back home."
