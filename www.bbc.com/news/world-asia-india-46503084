        Beyoncé took to the stage on Sunday night for the sangeet, an evening of music and dance that typically precedes the wedding.She shared photos on her Instagram account of her jewel-studded outfit and elaborate gold jewellery.  Her fee hasn't been made public, but would likely not have been a problem for the Ambanis.
