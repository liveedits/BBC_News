According to media reports, guests had been flown in on 100 chartered flights.Celebrity bloggers, entertainment writers and lifestyle magazines have been scouring Instagram to keep up with festivities.Beyoncé took to the stage on Sunday night for the sangeet, an evening of music and dance that typically precedes the wedding.She shared photos on her Instagram account of her jewel-studded outfit and elaborate gold jewellery.  Her fee hasn't been made public, but would likely not have been a problem for the Ambanis. Mukesh Ambani, managing director of  Reliance Industries, has a personal fortune of about $47bn (£37bn).
