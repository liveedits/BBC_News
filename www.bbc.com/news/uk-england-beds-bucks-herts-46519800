            A 14-year-old goalkeeper has died after he was injured in a "freak accident" involving another player at a youth football match.Luca Campanaro, a Bedgrove Dynamos player from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was hurt at an away match in Hillingdon, west London on Sunday. He was airlifted to the Royal London Hospital where he died on Monday. Luca's father, Americo Campanaro, said: "I feel like my heart has been ripped out." Mr Campanaro added: "He was a big lad, a big unit, that's why he was a goalkeeper, with a big heart to match. A gentle giant."
    
        
He said his son was "very popular" and would "do anything for anyone"."What happened on Sunday was a freak accident, but he went doing what he loved," he said.

                    Luca was an "avid" Tottenham fan
                
            His stepfather Adam Keedle described Luca as an "amazing young man and a real loss to the world" and said he could not offer "enough" praise to the medical staff who treated him at the scene and in hospital. Close family friend Dave Garricks confirmed the goalkeeper died "doing what he loved".Mr Garricks has set up a JustGiving page to raise funds for the family. It currently stands at more than Â£13,000. "I am shocked. It's no life at 14 to be taken," he said. He described The Mandeville School pupil as a dedicated footballer who loved the game and was an avid Tottenham Hotspur fan. Mr Campanaro said his son's organs would be donated and that "four lives are going to be saved because of Luca".
