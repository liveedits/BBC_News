            "The UN will play a leading role in the port and this will facilitate the humanitarian access and the flow of goods to the civilian population. And it will improve the living conditions for millions of Yemenis."Thursday's agreements could "be a starting point for peace and for ending [the] humanitarian crisis in Yemen", he said.
