            At least two policemen have died in an armed attack on the Chinese consulate in the Pakistani coastal city of Karachi, police say.Eyewitnesses reported a blast and gunfire at the site in the Clifton area, but details are still emerging.Gunmen appeared to have entered part of the consulate - one official said they had gone into the visa section.Local TV channels have broadcast images of a plume of smoke, although the nature of the blast is unclear.Security forces have been deployed and the area has been cordoned off, Pakistan's Geo TV said.
    
        
One security guard was also injured in the attack.China, which neighbours Pakistan, is a close ally and the country's main benefactor, investing huge amount of money in infrastructure projects.
