            A separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, has said it carried out the attack. It is thought to be one of many separatist groups operating in the restive province, which has seen a long running nationalist insurgency. "We have been seeing the Chinese as an oppressor, along with Pakistani forces," a spokesman for the group told the AFP news agency.Over the years construction projects and Chinese workers in Balochistan have been repeatedly targeted by militants. What is China doing in Balochistan?Balochistan is at the heart of an ambitious Chinese project, the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is a string of huge investments by China in Pakistani infrastructure.As China is such a close ally to Pakistan and has poured billions into the nation, this incident will deeply concern authorities who have described this investment as a "game changer", says the BBC's Secunder Kermani in Islamabad.Balochistan itself is a sparsely populated region, rich in gas and coal reserves, as well as copper and gold. Yet it has remained Pakistan's most impoverished area and Baloch nationalists have long accused the central government of exploitation and denying the province its due rights.
