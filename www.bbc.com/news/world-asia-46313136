All the staff inside the consulate are safe, local media reports said.Eyewitnesses reported seeing a blast, and local TV channels have broadcast images of a plume of smoke.A separatist group from the province of Balochistan has said it carried out the attack.China, which neighbours Pakistan, is a close ally and the country's main benefactor, investing huge amount of money in infrastructure projects.Balochistan, Pakistan's poorest province, is at the centre of a major Chinese investment project.
