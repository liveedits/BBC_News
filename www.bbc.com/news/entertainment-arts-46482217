Grammy Awards 2019: List of key nominees
Four of the major categories were expanded this year, to allow for more recognition for women and BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) artists.Song and album of the year are among the categories which will now have eight nominees, instead of five.The change comes after the Recording Academy created a diversity task force in response to criticism that the winners are usually disproportionately white and male.
