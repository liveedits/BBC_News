            Cardi B, Drake and Ariana Grande are expected to be among the contenders for this year's Grammys.The nominations for the biggest awards in music will be announced later.Four of the major categories are being expanded this year, which could mean more recognition for women and BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) artists.Song and album of the year are among the categories which will now have eight nominees, instead of five.The change comes after the Recording Academy created a diversity task force in response to criticism that the winners are usually disproportionately white and male.
