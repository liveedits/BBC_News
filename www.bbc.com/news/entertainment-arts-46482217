            Cardi B, Drake and Lady Gaga are among the nominees for this year's Grammys.Dua Lipa, Jorja Smith and Ella Mai are among the British nominees, which were revealed in full on Friday.Four of the major categories are being expanded this year, which could mean more recognition for women and BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) artists.Song and album of the year are among the categories which will now have eight nominees, instead of five.The change comes after the Recording Academy created a diversity task force in response to criticism that the winners are usually disproportionately white and male.
