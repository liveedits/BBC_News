Four of the major categories were expanded this year, to allow for more recognition for women and BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) artists.'Gender bias task force' launched by GrammysSong and album of the year are among the categories which will now have eight nominees, instead of five.The change comes after the Recording Academy created a diversity task force in response to criticism that the winners are usually disproportionately white and male.The categories which have been expanded are album of the year, record of the year (for best overall song), song of the year (which is specifically for songwriting) and best new artist.The other categories will continue to include five nominees.
