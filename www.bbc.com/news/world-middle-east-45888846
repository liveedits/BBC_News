            Yemen air strike: The school that's lost 42 children
            You may well remember - the pictures were hard to forget - the scene in Yemen in August when dozens of schoolchildren and adults were killed in an airstrike. The strike was carried out by a coalition - led by Saudi Arabia and backed by the US, the UK and France. They are supporting Yemen's government against the Houthi rebels - backed by Iran. In three years of fighting, at least 10,000 people have been killed and millions have fled their homes. Our correspondent Orla Guerin - with producer Nicola Careem and cameraman Lee Durant - sent this report from Dahyan in northern Yemen.
