Tensions have recently risen in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov off the Crimean peninsula - annexed by Russia in 2014.How did the crisis unfold?In the morning, Ukraine's Berdyansk and the Nikopol gunboats and the Yana Kapa tug tried to sail from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Mariupol in the Sea of Azov.Ukraine said the Russians tried to intercept the ships, ramming the tug. The vessels continued towards the Kerch Strait, but were prevented by the tanker.

                    A tanker under the bridge shut all navigation from and into the Sea of Azov
                
            Russia scrambled two fighter jets and two helicopters to the area. It accused the ships of illegally entering its waters said the traffic had been suspended for security reasons.The Ukrainian navy later said the boats were hit and disabled as they tried to leave the area. It said the tug was forced to stop.Ukraine said it had informed the Russians of its plan to move its ships through the sea to Mariupol.What's the background to this?The shallow Sea of Azov lies east of Crimea, and south of the Ukrainian regions partially seized by pro-Russian separatists. The two Ukrainian ports on its northern shore - Berdyansk and Mariupol - are key for exporting grain and produce such as steel, also for importing coal. In 2003, Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty that defined the Sea of Azov as internal waters of the two countries. The treaty guaranteed free navigation to all Ukrainian and Russian vessels.

        Media captionJonah Fisher talks to a commander of the Ukrainian Navy about the tensions in the Azov SeaBut Russia has recently begun inspecting all vessels going to or from Ukrainian ports. Earlier this month, the EU warned it would take "targeted measures" to address the issue."The situation in the Sea of Azov is damaging not only the Ukrainian economy, but also so many vessels that are flying the European Union member states' flags," EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said.The Russian inspections began soon after Ukraine detained a fishing vessel from Russian-annexed Crimea in March.Moscow also says the inspections of the vessels are necessary for security reasons, pointing to a potential threat to the bridge from Ukrainian radicals.
