            Ukraine's navy says Russia has fired on and seized three of its vessels off the coast of the annexed Crimea, in a major escalation of tensions.It said two gunboats and a tug were captured by Russian special forces after a chase. Two Ukrainian crew members were injured.Russia is yet to comment on the claims. The crisis began when Russia accused the Ukrainian ships of illegally entering its waters and stopped them from sailing into the Sea of Azov.The Russians placed a cargo ship under a bridge in the Kerch Straight. It is the only access to the Sea of Azov, which is shared between the two countries.

Ukraine names Russia as 'aggressor' state
Tensions have recently risen in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov off the Crimean peninsula - annexed by Russia in 2014.What's the latest?In a statement on Sunday evening, the Ukrainian navy said the Berdyansk and the Nikopol gunboats were hit and disabled as they tried to leave the area. It said the tug was forced to stop."There is also information that two Ukrainian sailors were injured," the statement said.Meanwhile, Russia's FSB security service said that the three Ukrainian vessels were returning home, Russia's Ria Novosti news agency reports.How did the events develop throughout the day?On Sunday morning, the Ukrainian ships tried to sail from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Mariupol in the Sea of Azov, Ukraine said.It said Russia then tried to intercept the boats with one vessel ramming the Ukraine's Yana Kapa tug. Russia later scrambled two fighter jets and two helicopters to monitor the Ukrainian vessels.After placing the tanker under the bridge that spans the Kerch Strait, Russia said the traffic was suspended for security reasons.Russian officials said Ukrainian naval reinforcements had been sent to the area and accused Kiev of trying "to create a conflict situation in this region".

                    A tanker under the bridge shut all navigation from and into the Sea of Azov
                
            But Ukraine said it had informed the Russians of its plan to move its ships through the sea to Mariupol.It said the Russian actions marked a breach of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.In recent weeks, a Ukrainian vessel was escorted by Russian tugs under the bridge without an incident.What's the background to this?The shallow Sea of Azov lies east of Crimea, and south of the Ukrainian regions partially seized by pro-Russian separatists. The two Ukrainian ports on its northern shore - Berdyansk and Mariupol - are key for exporting grain and produce such as steel, also for importing coal. In 2003, Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty that defined the Sea of Azov as internal waters of the two countries. The treaty guaranteed free navigation to all Ukrainian and Russian vessels.

Earlier this month, the EU warned it would take "targeted measures" to address the issue."The situation in the Sea of Azov is damaging not only the Ukrainian economy, but also so many vessels that are flying the European Union member states' flags," EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said.The Russian inspections began soon after Ukraine detained a fishing vessel from Russian-annexed Crimea in March.Moscow also says the inspections of the vessels are necessary for security reasons, pointing to a potential threat to the bridge from Ukrainian radicals.
