            US President Donald Trump has strongly defended ties with Saudi Arabia despite international condemnation of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder. The kingdom is a "steadfast partner" that has agreed to invest "a record amount of money" in the US, Mr Trump said in a statement.The president acknowledged Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman "could very well" have known about Khashoggi's murder. "In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia," he added. Mr Khashoggi was murdered on 2 October on a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
