            Nasa Mars InSight lander mission to teach us more about Earth
            Nasa's Mars InSight lander is due to arrive on the Red Planet's surface on Monday night. It's going to use seismometers to study the planet's interior so we can learn more about how it formed and why it's so different from Earth.Video journalist: Laura Foster
