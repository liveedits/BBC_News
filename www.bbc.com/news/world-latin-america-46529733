"Apparently he shot in several directions, not directed at anyone specifically."Most of those who were hit were elderly, the newspaper reports. There is some confusion over the exact number of fatalities, with some reports putting the number at four.Police officers outside the cathedral immediately entered after hearing the shots. Paramedics could be seen treating people at the scene.
