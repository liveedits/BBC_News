                    On average, the US population can expect to live around 78 years - nearly a decade less than the world's highest life expectancy rate
                
            Life expectancy in the US has dropped once again, thanks in part to rising suicide and drug overdose rates, according to new government reports.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found nearly 70,000 more Americans died in 2017 than 2016, with rising rates of death among 25- to 44-year-olds.Thursday's reports revealed synthetic opioid-related overdose death rates rose by 45% on average, nationwide.The suicide rate is also the highest it has been in decades.Americans can expect to live just over 78 years and six months on average - a 0.1 year drop from 2016, according to the report released on Thursday.
    
        
"Tragically, this troubling trend is largely driven by deaths from drug overdose and suicide," said CDC director Robert Redfield in a statement."Life expectancy gives us a snapshot of the nation's overall health and these sobering statistics are a wake-up call that we are losing too many Americans, too early and too often, to conditions that are preventable."The top 10 leading causes of death - including heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and suicide - were the same as in 2016, accounting for the majority of deaths.Only cancer death rates decreased by 2.1%, while the rates for most other causes increased.US women continue to outlive men, and the death rate did decrease among 45- to 54-year-olds.Between 2016 and 2017, mortality rates also decreased for black women, and there was no significant change in rates for black men and Hispanic Americans.Why US suicide rate is on the rise

Urban-area suicide rates were 16% higher in 2017 than 1999, and rural-area suicides increased by 53% over the same time period.Mental illness 'doesn't discriminate'Dr Jerry Reed of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention told the BBC that suicide is not always just a mental health challenge."Economic conditions or livelihood opportunities in decline could lead people to positions where they're at risk. We need to intervene in both mental and public health cases," Dr Reed says.
