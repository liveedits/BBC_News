            Mental health: Mum 'didn't know extent' of son's problems
            A woman whose son took his own life is backing a call by Samaritans Cymru for mental health education to be compulsory in schools.Rachel Degaetano's son Chae died in 2015 at the age of 21, and she says she "didn't realise how much he was struggling". The Welsh Government said it has launched a new curriculum dedicated to mental wellbeing and schools in England will deliver mental health education from 2020. If you are struggling to cope, you can call Samaritans free on 116 123 (UK and Ireland) or visit the BBC Action Line website.You can also contact the Community Advice and Listening Line for Wales, which offers free confidential support with help to find local mental health services, on 0800 132 737 or text 'Help' to 81066.
