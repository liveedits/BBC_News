            The electric scooter scheme taking over Paris
            Hundreds of the two-wheeled vehicles have appeared on the city's streets, but some residents have voiced concerns over the scheme.The issue has made its way to French government, where a bill has been presented which would ban scooters from riding on pavements. Scooter campaigners say the answer lies in creating more scooter and bike lanes.
