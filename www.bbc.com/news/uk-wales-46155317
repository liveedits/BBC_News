            Aberystwyth dad's hilarious football coaching goes viral
            This dad takes fatherly encouragement to another level. Bow Street Magpies under-8s were cruising at 2-0 up against Llanilar under-8s before this happened to make it 2-1. But not for one father's want of trying as he pushes his distracted son into the path of the ball, which then ricochets into the path of the opposition striker who puts it away. Llanilar went on to equalise and the game ended 2-2.Video courtesy of Bethan Davies
