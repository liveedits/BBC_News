            After a photo of an adorable white reindeer went viral this week, other people have shared their snaps of the animals.  Dr Nicholas Tyler, from the Centre for Saami Studies at the University of Tromso in Norway, told the BBC that white reindeer are rare. However, he adds that they are "highly conspicuous", especially in the summer months, which may go some way to explain why people are able to get so many great photographs of them.

            While some people refer to these animals as "albino", it is likely these animals have a different condition.As can be seen in these photos, the reindeer have white fur but do not lack pigment in their eyes. 
    
        
Glen Jeffery, from the Institute of Ophthalmology at University College London, explains that the production of pigment in the skin and eyes are controlled independently. This means that the animals do not suffer from the visual difficulties associated with albinism. "For animals where pigment generation fails in the eye, the world becomes terribly bright... as light bounces around in the eye because it's not absorbed by pigment."
