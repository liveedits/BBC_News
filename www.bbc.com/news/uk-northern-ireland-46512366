Speaking at the inaugural Albert Reynolds Memorial lecture in County Longford, he was critical of those he described as "believing themselves to be unionists".He warned of the dangers of violence returning in Northern Ireland if physical checks or infrastructure were put in place at the border again after Brexit.
