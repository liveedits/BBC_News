            Funeral prayers have taken place in Saudi Arabia and Turkey for murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Khashoggi's son Salah met mourners in Jeddah. Hundreds attended prayers in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, as well as in Istanbul, Turkey.The body of Khashoggi, who was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October, has not been found. Saudi Arabia says an officer ordered Khashoggi's murder, not Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Turkey insists the order came from the highest levels.
    
        
The decision to hold funeral prayers in the absence of his body suggests that the family does not expect it to be recovered.

            Last month Salah, a dual Saudi-US citizen, met Saudi King Salman and the crown prince in Riyadh to receive condolences along with other relatives. He then left for Washington after a travel ban was lifted. While in the US he told broadcaster CNN that he wanted to bury his father in Medina with the rest of the family."We just need to make sure that he rests in peace," Salah Khashoggi said.Khashoggi's fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, previously told the BBC that losing him had left her in shock and that being unable to "say goodbye" made his death even more difficult to accept."If someone dies, you have to see them to come to terms with their death," she said, adding: "That hasn't happened here."
