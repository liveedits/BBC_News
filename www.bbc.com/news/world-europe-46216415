                    Mr Barnier said a Brexit transition period could be extended by mutual consent
                
            The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says "decisive" progress has been made in reaching a final agreement on the UK's departure from the bloc.Mr Barnier said a 585-page draft withdrawal agreement published on Wednesday represented a "crucial step in concluding these negotiations".His comments came after UK Prime Minister Theresa May said her cabinet had backed the draft agreement.Mr Barnier will met EU Council head Donald Tusk on Friday morning.He will formally tell him a landmark in the negotiations has been passed, meaning a summit can now be held leading to the signing of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.
    
        
Mr Barnier will then head to Strasbourg to brief the European Parliament whose approval of the agreement will ultimately be needed before the UK leaves the EU next March.The leaders of the other 27 EU nations will also need to approve the deal.Brexit: A guide to where we are

Meanwhile, Mrs May faces a battle to get the completed deal through the UK Parliament.If the agreement is approved by both sides, a 21-month transition period will kick in, during which a trade deal and the thorny issue of how to ensure there is no physical border between Northern Ireland - part of the UK - and the Republic of Ireland will need to be worked out.A smooth border-free exchange underpins the peace deal that ended the Northern Ireland conflict.What did Barnier say was in the document?The draft withdrawal agreement covers so-called "divorce" issues as the UK prepares to leave the EU. It includes a "financial settlement" from the UK, thought to be about £39bn (€45bn; $50bn).Speaking at a press briefing in Brussels, Mr Barnier addressed one of the major concerns of the divorce, the Irish "hard border" issue.He said that to avoid the need for physical checks on goods or infrastructure at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the EU would work with the UK to agree a trade deal. However if talks fail, the so-called "backstop" measure would be used.Q&A: Irish border backstop

Both sides have resolved to ensure the backstop is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements."If we are not ready by 2020, we can extend the provision so we have more time, and if we are still not there with the future agreement after this, the backstop agreement would kick in," he said. "There will be a UK-wide single customs territory which Northern Ireland will remain in, and Northern Ireland will remain aligned to the rules of a single market essential for avoiding a border including on agriculture policy."

The draft withdrawal agreement states that the transition period may be extended by mutual consent.What does the transition period mean?Mr Barnier said that any extension would by a one-off, "by a limited period and by joint agreement".During the transition, the UK will be out of the EU. It will have no voting rights but will continue to abide by the majority of its rules.There are also special protocols in place for Gibraltar and Cyprus to enable people there "to continue to live as they do today", he added.Spain has longstanding claims to the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar and the deal sets out bilateral co-operation on customs, policing, trade, taxation and citizens' rights.The UK has sovereign military bases in Cyprus. EU law will continue to apply at the bases, with the deal securing the rights of the 11,000 Cypriot civilians working there.How have other European leaders reacted?The European Parliament's Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt welcomed the news, saying that the agreement would provide "protection of citizens rights and the avoidance of a hard Irish border"."While I hope one day the UK will return, in the meantime this agreement will make Brexit possible, while maintaining a close relationship," Mr Verhofstadt said in a statement.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker tweeted to say he had recommended a summit take place with the EU and the UK following Mrs May's announcement that her cabinet had backed the deal.
