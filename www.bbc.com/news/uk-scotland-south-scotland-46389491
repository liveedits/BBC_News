            Insp Craig Nicolson said on Thursday: "We are very worried about Mr and Mrs Kenneavy."We know the Drummore coastal road was closed last night due to coastal flooding, but I would ask anyone that saw the vehicle or who knows the whereabouts of the couple to contact Police Scotland."We have been carrying out searches in and around Drummore all day with the assistance of the coastguard and these searches remain ongoing at this time."Extremely treacherousDrummore villager Edward Beck, who has known Mr Kenneavy for more than 30 years, said locals had been aware of weather warnings from the Met Office and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.He described how conditions along the coastal route could be extremely treacherous and said storm waves of up to 60ft high could affect the main road into the village.He added: "You can be driving through three, four feet of water and a lot of cars can suck water into the engine and you can get stranded. That part [of the road] actually looks like it's in the sea if you hit it at the right time."
