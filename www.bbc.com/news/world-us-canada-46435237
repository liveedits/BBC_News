        An extended saluteBBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher, Capitol HillThree hours after an assemblage of officials, dignitaries, family and friends welcomed the coffin of President George HW Bush to the US Capitol, the current president and first lady made a mid-evening visit to pay their respects.The motorcade took only a few minutes to travel down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. At 20:30 (01:30 GMT on Tuesday) Donald and Melania Trump arrived inside what was now a relatively empty Capitol rotunda. Members of the five branches of the US military continued to stand to attention, as the two approached the flag-draped coffin.The president gave an extended salute and the first lady put her hand over her heart. The only sound in the massive, marbled room - where 32 people, including 12 presidents, have lain in state - was the steady whirr of press cameras.Mr and Mrs Trump then turned and left. In all, the president was away from the White House less than half an hour, without a word to the public or press.
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        The public will be able to pay respects at the rotunda until Wednesday's invitation-only funeral service at the National Cathedral.Mr Trump will attend with Melania but will not deliver a speech.According to Mark Updegrove's book The Last Republicans, which came out last year, Mr Bush voted for Mr Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton in the election and had called Mr Trump a "blowhard".
