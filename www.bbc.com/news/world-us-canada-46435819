What did senators say?Influential members of the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations did not mince words after the CIA briefing on Tuesday."You have to be wilfully blind not to come to the conclusion that this was orchestrated and organised by people under the command of MBS," Mr Graham said, using the crown prince's initials.The senator said he could not support arms sales to Saudi Arabia as long as the Saudi crown prince remained in power, or the kingdom's war in Yemen. "There is not a smoking gun - there is a smoking saw," the senator added, referring to Khashoggi's alleged dismemberment.

Guilty."Mr Corker suggested that President Donald Trump was condoning the murder of a journalist by refusing to condemn the Saudi crown prince.Who was Jamal Khashoggi?As a prominent journalist, he covered major stories including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of Osama Bin Laden for various Saudi news organisations.
