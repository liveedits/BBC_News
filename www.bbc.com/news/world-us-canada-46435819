Jamal Khashoggi: The story so far
What did senators say?Members of the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations did not mince words after the briefing by CIA Director Gina Haspel on Tuesday.
    
        
"You have to be wilfully blind not to come to the conclusion that this was orchestrated and organised by people under the command of MBS," Mr Graham said, using the crown prince's initials.The senator said he could not support Saudi Arabia's border war with Yemen or arms sales to Riyadh as long as the crown prince remained in power. "There is not a smoking gun - there is a smoking saw," the senator added, referring to Khashoggi's alleged dismemberment in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.Senator Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, told reporters he was "now more convinced than I was before" that the crown prince was culpable in the journalist's slaying.He said the US must "send a clear and unequivocal message that such actions are not acceptable in the world's stage".

Guilty."Mr Corker suggested that President Donald Trump had condoned the murder of a journalist by refusing to condemn the Saudi crown prince.Fellow Republican senator Richard Shelby of Alabama said: "Now the question is, how do you separate the Saudi crown prince and his group from the nation?"The Senate is planning to vote on a proposal to end US military involvement in Yemen, after members of both parties advanced the resolution last week.What has the CIA said?The CIA has concluded Mohammed bin Salman "probably ordered" the killing of KhashoggiThe spy agency has evidence he exchanged messages with Saud al-Qahtani, who allegedly oversaw the Saudi reporter's murder.The CIA director was absent from a recent congressional briefing by cabinet members.Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary James Mattis told senators there was no direct evidence of the crown prince's involvement in Khashoggi's death.President Donald Trump has said the CIA findings on the crown prince were not conclusive. On 20 November he said: "It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't."
