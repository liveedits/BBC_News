        Cambodia has seized more than 3.2 tonnes of African ivory hidden in a storage container from Mozambique, a customs official has said. The discovery of 1,026 tusks at the Phnom Penh Autonomous Port on Thursday followed a tip off from the US embassy. The shipment arrived in the country last year and its unknown recipient did not arrive at the port to pick it up. Demand from China and Vietnam has meant Cambodia has become a key transit point for the illicit wildlife trade."The elephant tusks were hidden among marble in a container that was abandoned," Sun Chhay, director of the Customs and Excise Office at the port, told the AFP news agency.
