        The footage was taken just before midnight on Friday and was released by police shortly after. It doesn't show the moment the man pops the question but we do see him getting down on one knee in an attempt to find the ring.His fianc√©e, who police confirmed said "Yes", puts her hands to her face when she realises what has happened. She crouches down next to him, trying to help but they are unsuccessful.The man then lies down on the floor by the grate, trying to reach the piece of jewellery but again they are unable to retrieve it.Officers from the New York Police Department clearly have a romantic side and, more importantly, access to the grate, so could get it out quite easily.Earlier, they had put out a plea for the man and woman to come forward.
