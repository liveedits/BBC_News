                    The question of whether Theresa May will have the support to continue as prime minister still dominates the papers. The Sunday Telegraph reports that 25 letters of no confidence in the PM have been submitted - with Tory MP Zac Goldsmith adding his to the pile.

                    Theresa May has allowed Britain to be "blackmailed and bullied" by Brussels - that's according to the former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab in an interview with the Sunday Times. It quotes him as saying the PM should walk away from the talks rather than submit to the "predatory" behaviour of "dark forces" in Brussels.

            It's no surprise to see Brexit dominating the Sunday papers. "Plot to oust May nears tipping point," declares the headline in the Sunday Telegraph.It reports that Conservative MPs Zac Goldsmith and Bill Cash are the latest to submit letters of no confidence in the prime minister, bringing the known total to 25 - 48 are required to trigger a vote.   The Sunday Times says seven leading Tories are actively preparing leadership campaigns.  It leads with an interview with one of them - Dominic Raab - whose message to Theresa May is "stand up to the bullies" in Brussels.  In what the paper says is "a thinly veiled pitch for her job", Mr Raab, who resigned as Brexit secretary on Thursday, says Britain would not look like it was "frightened of its own shadow" if he were running negotiations.However Mr Raab's insistence that he was "hoodwinked" over late changes made to the draft agreement, are given short shrift in the Mail on Sunday.The paper quotes a senior government source as saying the claim was "dishonest" and Mr Raab "knew exactly what was coming" but was "unwilling to take any responsibility".

            The Sunday Times reports that a team of army planners have started drawing up emergency measures for deploying troops in the event of any chaos caused by a no-deal Brexit. Citing a 'well placed army source', the paper says around 20 officers based in Hampshire are drawing up plans on how to keep order, ease traffic and deliver medicines. Elsewhere, the Sunday Times also reports that the Royal Navy is suffering from a "profound" shortage of sailors. A Royal Navy officer tells the paper that there are barely enough sailors to run four of the six £1bn Type 45 destroyers, and ships are often going to sea without enough people to maintain or operate equipment that would be vital in wartime.

        The Foreign Office is facing criticism from survivors of terror attacks, reports the Observer.British survivors and families whose loved ones have been caught up in terror attacks abroad say the response of British officials is often poor and unprofessional, with some even saying they were told relatives had survived when they'd been killed. The campaign group Survivors against Terror will publish a report later - the first of its kind - based on interviews with 270 people who have been affected by terrorism. The Foreign Office says it will use the feedback to improve.
