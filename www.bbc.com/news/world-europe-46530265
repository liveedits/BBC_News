        Panic in the cityThe attack unfolded at around 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) close to Strasbourg's famed Christmas market, which attracts thousands of visitors at this time of year.Eyewitness Pater Fritz told the BBC he heard gunfire and found a person who had been shot, lying on a bridge. He said he tried to resuscitate him but the man died."There are no ambulance services able to enter the area, apparently," he said, adding: "After 45 minutes we stopped the resuscitation [attempt], because a doctor told us on the phone that it was senseless."
