        One person has been killed and 10 others wounded in a shooting in the eastern French city of Strasbourg, police say.The gunman has been identified and is being actively looked for, they added.The French Interior Ministry confirmed a "serious public security incident" in the city, and residents in the Neudorf area have been urged to stay indoors.The shooting is said to have happened close to a Christmas market in one of the central squares, Place Kleber.Security officials have cordoned off the area and trams have been stopped, according to reports.
    
        
The motive for the attack is unclear, but the Christmas market has been the object of Islamist threats in the past, Hugh Schofield reports from Paris.
