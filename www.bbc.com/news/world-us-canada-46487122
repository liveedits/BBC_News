        Will Democrats derail his appointment?Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, WashingtonOn paper William Barr looks like a safe pick for US attorney general. Since serving under George HW Bush, he's spent most of his career as a corporate lawyer, so he's more than familiar with Washington's corridors of power.Mr Barr is the kind of nominee Senate Republicans - whose votes will be needed for confirmation - know and are comfortable with. He's not exactly a drain-the-Washington-swamp choice, but that has never been a priority in the gilded halls of the upper chamber of Congress.This, of course, is no normal time - and it didn't take long for interested parties to scour Mr Barr's recent comments and writings in search of any meaningful hints on how he would oversee Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Democrats won't be encouraged to learn that he expressed support for Donald Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey and recommended further investigation of Democrat Hillary Clinton.It's going to be months before Mr Barr receives a Senate vote, and the scouring will surely continue. Contentious confirmation hearings are all but a given. This, however, is a nomination that will be difficult for Democrats to derail.
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        Who is William Barr?The 68-year-old Republican lawyer has an impressive political resume, spanning the CIA, White House and Department of Justice.Mr Barr holds degrees in government and Chinese studies from Columbia University.While studying law at George Washington University, he worked at the CIA from 1973-1977. As a young lawyer, he clerked for the DC appeals court.For a year, Mr Barr was a member of President Ronald Reagan's domestic policy staff at the White House; a role he eventually left to pursue corporate law.In 1989, he was appointed by President Bush to head the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. He was promoted to deputy attorney general next, and then to the top role.

            After passing his senate confirmation hearing unanimously, he served as the 77th US attorney general from 1991-1993. As the top US law official at that time, he oversaw Robert Mueller, who was then leading the department's criminal division.Mr Barr retired from his position as counsel and executive vice-president of Verizon in 2008.What has he said about the Russia inquiry?Mr Barr has voiced disapproval over some aspects of the inquiry but his views on the investigation's legitimacy remain unknown.He has said that Robert Mueller hired too many prosecutors with Democratic campaign ties for his investigative team - telling the Washington Post he "would have liked to see [Mueller] have more balance".In a 2017 opinion piece for the Post, Mr Barr said Mr Trump had been right to fire FBI director James Comey because he "crossed a line" by announcing the outcome of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.He has also defended Mr Trump's desire for a criminal investigation against Hillary Clinton to the New York Times, adding that some of her actions merited an inquiry more than any Trump-Russia collusion.The Times has described Mr Barr as a lawyer with a vision for broad presidential powers, but also one who sees the attorney general's duty as avoiding political considerations.What's the reaction?On Twitter, many are wondering why Mr Barr chose to accept the role again, and what he might make of Mr Trump's latest tweets deriding the Russian inquiry.Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal has already called for Mr Barr to firmly commit to protect Mr Mueller's investigation.
