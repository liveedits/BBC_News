        Theresa May will return to Brussels for Brexit talks this weekend as the UK and EU strive to do a deal in time for Sunday's summit of European leaders.The PM said progress had been made during discussions with EU officials on Wednesday and she hoped to reach a deal "in the interests of all our people". But the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the process was "not going to plan".Spain has said it will not agree to the Brexit deal unless changes are made to the wording over Gibraltar. The EU is in a race against time to complete the text of its declaration on future relations with the UK, amid concerns from several member states.

The BBC's Adam Fleming said the timetable was not going to plan, both sides having hoped to agree the document initially on Tuesday and then again on Wednesday.He said the "real deadline" in Brussels to get an agreement and ensure Sunday's summit went ahead was now considered to be Friday morning - when ministerial aides meet.

After an hour of talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Mrs May sought to strike an upbeat note but signalled talks were set to continue until the eve of Sunday's summit."We've made further progress and as a result we have given sufficient direction to our negotiators, I hope, for them to resolve the remaining issues and that work will start immediately," she said."I now plan to return for further meetings on Saturday to discuss how we can bring to a conclusion this process and bring it to a conclusion in the interests of all our people."What is the political declaration?The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 and, under the terms of the draft withdrawal agreement, there will then be a 21-month transition period up to the end of 2020.The future relations document sets out the basis for economic, security and defence co-operation from the start of 2021 onwards.The UK has said it hopes to agree a trade deal by then although most observers believe it will take much longer, based on other trade agreements. When it was first published last Wednesday, the document was just seven pages long and has since been extended to 20 pages.In a statement on Wednesday, the UK said its objectives included a free trade area for goods with zero tariffs on UK products, an end to membership of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy and "ambitious arrangements for trade in services".What is holding the agreement up?The French, Dutch and Danish governments are said to be concerned about the amount of access their fishing fleets will get to British waters.There are broader concerns about what the Brexit agreement will mean for the future of the single market, if the UK ends up enjoying preferential access to EU markets but does not have to comply with freedom of movement rules.The other major issue is the future of Gibraltar, the British overseas territory which Spain has long laid claim to.Madrid wants a veto over applying any agreement on post-transition relations to Gibraltar, but Mrs May told MPs that the disputed principality would not be "excluded" from the document.
