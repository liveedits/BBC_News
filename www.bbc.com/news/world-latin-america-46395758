        Media captionWhy tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so highMr Trump said he would not meet the Russian leader "based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned".The decision also follows the US president's former lawyer Michael Cohen pleading guilty to lying to Congress about a Trump property deal in Russia during the 2016 election.Mr Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, responded: "If this is so, the president will have a couple of extra hours in the programme for useful meetings on the sidelines of the summit."German Chancellor Angela Merkel blamed the crisis "entirely" on Russia and said she would raise the issue with Mr Putin.Mrs Merkel's own arrival at the summit has been delayed by a technical fault in her plane.How intense is the trade war?President Trump said recently that current tariff levels on $200bn (Â£157bn) of Chinese imports would rise as planned.He also threatened tariffs on $267bn of other Chinese exports to the US.US-China trade row: What has happened so far?Speaking to reporters at the White House, he said that while China was interested in striking a deal, "I don't know if I want to do it" and "I like the deal we have now".The US has hit a total of $250bn of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products."I think the most likely scenario is that [Chinese President] Xi Jinping doesn't offer big enough concessions to Trump, and so nothing much comes of the G20 meeting," said Julian Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics.What can Crown Prince Mohammed expect?International indignation over Khashoggi's murder, which was carried out inside Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul on 2 October, continued on Thursday as Canada slapped sanctions on 17 Saudi nationals allegedly linked to his murder.

        Bad timing for Argentina's leaderBy Katy Watson, South America correspondent, BBC News  This was meant to be a big moment for Argentina. A chance to show world leaders that with Mauricio Macri at the helm, the country meant business.When he was elected in 2015, Mr Macri promised market-friendly reforms to get Argentina's isolated economy back on track. Fast-forward three years and he's hosting this summit in a new political era - one where protectionism and populism, not globalisation, are the order of the day. And while over the next few days Mr Macri will want to make a good impression for his visitors, he's struggling with his reputation closer to home. Inflation is high, economic growth is sluggish, the peso has plummeted and the country has had to rely on a $57bn loan from the deeply unpopular IMF to try to get itself out of the crisis. It's not great timing for a president who is expected to seek re-election next year.Argentina to axe half its ministries
