        The tables give a snapshot of how each school is performing in results and pupil progress but they also provide a huge amount of data on education at a national level.The government has said the attainment of disadvantaged pupils is a key aim of its education policies.
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        The achievement gap has shrunk every year since 2011 but at a slow pace.If this pace continues, the gap in attainment at this early age will not close until at least 2070, BBC analysis reveals.To assess this gap, the government uses pupils' results in reading and maths tests.These are ranked from best to worst as if they were the results of a race. On average, poorer pupils rank worse. This difference in average ranking between poorer and better-off children is the disadvantage gap. The current gap shows that poorer children would sit 2.9 places further back on average in a ranking of 20 poorer and 20 better-off children.

        Media captionExplaining the disadvantage gap in primary school test resultsSchool Standards Minister Nick Gibb said: "Standards are rising in our schools, with 86% of schools now rated good or outstanding as of August 2018, compared to 68% in 2010 and these statistics show that the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers has closed by 13% since 2010."In 2011, the disadvantage gap was 3.3 places, it is now 2.9 places, having closed by 13% or 0.4 places.Mr Gibb added: "Every child, regardless of their background, deserves a high quality education and opportunity to fulfil their potential." Children are counted as disadvantaged if they are eligible for the pupil premium, that is if they have been eligible for free school meals at any point during the past six years or have been in care continuously for at least six months.Data published in July revealed 64% of pupils met the expected standard across all tests: reading, writing and mathematics - up from 61% the previous year.
