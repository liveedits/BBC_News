                    Drummore coastal road was closed on Wednesday due to heavy rain and flooding
                
            Local people said conditions on the coastal route could be extremely treacherous, and large storm waves could affect the main road into the village. On Friday villager Edward Beck told BBC Radio Scotland Good Morning Scotland programme that local people were aware of weather and flood warnings. He added: "You can be driving through three, four feet of water and a lot of cars can suck water into the engine and you can get stranded. "That part [of the road] actually looks like it's in the sea if you hit it at the right time."

            The missing couple's neighbours, George Gregory and Lynne Copland, said they were well known in the small village. Mr Gregory told BBC Scotland: "I have been here more than 20 years now and Jim lived here when I first came here and he was just one of the local characters, I guess. A nice friendly fellow. A very nice couple."Ms Copland said the incident had been a "shock to the system". She added: "They were a lovely couple. If you met either of them outside in the street, they would stand and talk to you for as long as you wanted. They were a really, really nice couple."
