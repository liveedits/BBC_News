            The bus company, which is part of the Stagecoach group, was sentenced alongside Chander, who was diagnosed with dementia after the crash, at a two-day hearing at Birmingham Crown Court.
    
        
Judge Paul Farrer said "the failings of the company were a significant cause" of the crash.Warnings about Chander were "not enforced, and almost immediately ignored," he said.Chander was handed a two-year supervision order, meaning he will be monitored by a doctor.

            Phil Medlicott, managing director of Midland Red (South) Ltd said the company is "deeply sorry" and "bears the weight of our responsibility for this tragedy"."We deeply regret the opportunities that were missed to act decisively on emerging warning signs," he said.The bus company admitted failings including allowing Chander to work in excess of 70-hours a week and allowing him to continue working despite warnings about his driving.A trial of facts in September found Chander had been warned about his "erratic" driving by the company after four crashes in three years.
