        According to Hurriyet newspaper, this is the fifth helicopter crash to happen in Istanbul in the last 20 years.In March 2017, seven people died when a helicopter hit a television tower on the outskirts of the city. Four Russians were among the dead. Seven people died and eight others were injured in July 2016 when a Turkish military helicopter crashed in the north-east of the country. This is also the most recent incident involving the death of Turkish soldiers. Earlier this month, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reportedly announced seven soldiers had died and 25 more were injured after an ammunition depot exploded in the south-eastern province of Hakkari. In October, two soldiers reportedly froze to death on an operation near the city of Tunceli.
