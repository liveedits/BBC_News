        With two days to go until the crucial Brexit vote, the prime minister has warned MPs they face "uncharted waters" if they reject her deal. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, the PM said a rejection of her proposals would mean "grave uncertainty" for the UK.She warned MPs their actions could lead to a general election, and there was a "very real risk of no Brexit".Downing Street has also denied newspaper suggestions that Theresa May could postpone Tuesday's vote."The vote is going ahead," a spokesman said.

Last month, the UK agreed a Brexit deal with the EU - but it still needs to be approved by Parliament.Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the DUP, the SNP and dozens of Conservative MPs have said they cannot support the deal, meaning it is unlikely to pass.If the deal is rejected, it is unclear what happens next - with Mrs May insisting her deal was best for the country."When I say if this deal does not pass we would truly be in uncharted waters, I hope people understand this is what I genuinely believe and fear could happen," Mrs May said."It would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal."She accused Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of thinking of "nothing but attempting to bring about a general election, no matter what the cost to the country" and, in a warning to Tory rebels, said: "I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take."Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that the deal allowed the UK to leave the EU "in an orderly and smooth way". The Brexiteer added: "I understand why people who want to stay in the EU want to do it down... I'm very surprised that people on our side of the argument... are willing to blow up a deal which actually delivers a very good path out of the EU."

However, in the Telegraph, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said Mrs May's deal would cause  "long-term damage" and called on the government to make a final attempt to renegotiate its terms.And Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet over the deal, told Sky Mrs May should "immediately" renegotiate with Brussels, if MPs reject her deal. Asked if she would consider a leadership bid, she said it was not about "personalities" but about the deal and she would back the PM if she renegotiated the deal.But she did not rule it out, saying she'd give it "serious consideration" if she were asked to stand. Meanwhile Conservative MP Will Quince has announced he is stepping down as a ministerial aide in the Ministry of Defence saying the deal negotiated "irrevocably weakens the UK's negotiating position".And while Mrs May has warned of uncertain times should she lose the vote on Tuesday, MPs have said a similar fate awaits if the deal is passed in the House of Commons.The Commons Committee on Exiting the European Union said Mrs May's deal did not give enough clarity or certainty about the future, describing it as a "huge step into the unknown". The committee described the draft political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and the UK as "neither detailed nor substantive".
