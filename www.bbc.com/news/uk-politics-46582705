        Theresa May has attacked one of her predecessors - accusing Tony Blair of "undermining" the Brexit talks by calling for another referendum.She called his comments an "insult to the office he once held" and said MPs could not "abdicate responsibility" to deliver Brexit by holding a new poll.Mr Blair said MPs might back a new vote if "none of the other options work".It comes after Labour MPs who support the idea met Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington to make their case.About 10 MPs met Mr Lidington on Thursday to argue for another public vote and make it clear there was no other government plan they could support.

BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said Mrs May's criticism of Mr Blair was striking for its anger.Mrs May said: "For Tony Blair to go to Brussels and seek to undermine our negotiations by advocating for a second referendum is an insult to the office he once held and the people he once served."We cannot, as he would, abdicate responsibility for this decision."Parliament has a democratic duty to deliver what the British people voted for."She added that there were "too many people who want to subvert the process for their own political interests - rather than acting in the national interest".
