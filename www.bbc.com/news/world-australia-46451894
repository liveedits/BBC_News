            A rare marsupial that once ran wild in Australia's New South Wales has been reintroduced into the state for the first time in more than a century.  Bilbies - small nocturnal mammals with long, rabbit-like ears - were last recorded in the state in 1912. But now 30 captive-bred animals were released into a large predator-free enclosure near the town of Narrabri, northwest of Sydney.This is seen as a major victory in efforts to save them from extinction.

            However, without the protection of a 32km (20 miles) fence they probably would not survive, the BBC's Phil Mercer in Sydney reports.
    
        
Bilbies - who feed on plant roots, ants, beetles and spiders - disappeared in Australia's most populous state before the start of World War One following the introduction of predators including cats and foxes.'Rewilding' may rescue vulnerable Australian animalsBilbies are currently listed as vulnerable species.
