                    The Ukrainian navy accuses Russia of ramming and damaging one of its tugs
                
            Ukraine has accused Russia of ramming one of its boats off the coast of Crimea, amid rising naval tensions.A Ukrainian navy statement says the "openly aggressive actions" occurred as three of its vessels sailed to Mariupol in the Sea of Azov.Its tug, named Yana Kapu, allegedly suffered damage to its engine, guard rail and outer shell. But Russia said the ships were in its waters, and accused the Ukrainians of "provocative actions". The Sea of Azov lies east of the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and south of regions held by pro-Russian separatists.
