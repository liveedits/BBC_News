Writing in Country Life, the prince talks about his love of food and the magazine features one of his favourite recipes - pheasant crumble pie.He says: "I got this recipe from someone I know. It is delicious."I invented a grouse one recently, coq au vin with grouse, as well as moussaka with grouse. It doesn't always have to be lamb - in other words, groussaka!"

            He also describes how red squirrels visit his Birkhall home on the Queen's Balmoral estate.The prince says: "They come into the house at Birkhall and we get them chasing each other round and round the inside."Sometimes when I leave my jackets on a chair with nuts in the pockets, I see them with their tails sticking out, as they hunt for nuts - they are incredibly special creatures."Clarence House tweeted birthday wishes to the prince with a video montage of pictures from each decade of his life, showing him with his family and enjoying pursuits like polo, sailing and flying, as well as performing official duties.
