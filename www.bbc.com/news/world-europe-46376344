            Salome Zurabishvili has won Georgia's presidential election, becoming the first woman to hold the office.With nearly all votes counted, the French-born ex-diplomat had 59% of the vote with rival Grigol Vashadze on 40%.Ms Zurabishvili was backed by the ruling Georgian Dream party while Mr Vashadze was a united opposition candidate.A new constitution is due to come into force, making the role of president largely ceremonial.Ms Zurabishvili favours balancing Georgia's relations with Russia and the West.

            However the election is also seen as an indicator of how parliamentary elections in 2020 could go.Western countries are also watching the vote in a country seeking European Union and Nato membership.The opposition has complained of voting irregularities and attacks on its campaigners, but this has been denied by the ruling party. International observers said the first round of voting last month was held on an "unlevel playing field".
