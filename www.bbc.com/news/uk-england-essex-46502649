            A 26-year-old man has appeared in court in New Zealand charged with the murder of British backpacker Grace Millane.Miss Millane, 22, disappeared in Auckland on 1 December - police ended their search on Sunday after finding a body in the outskirts of the city.The man, who cannot be named, is due back in court next month.Court documents showed he had been living at the Citylife Hotel on Queen Street in central Auckland, which is where Miss Millane was last seen.The judge acknowledged Miss Millane's family's grief "must be desperate". 
    
        
Documents also showed police believe the University of Lincoln graduate from Essex was killed between 1 December and 2 December.At a news conference, the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said there was an "overwhelming sense of hurt and shame that this has happened in our country".

"Your daughter should have been safe here, and she wasn't, and I'm sorry for that."The body - which has not yet been formally identified but the police believe to be Miss Millane's - was found "about 10 metres" off Scenic Drive, a countryside road outside the city, Det Insp Scott Beard said.
