Mr Assange, an Australian citizen, claimed asylum in Ecuador's London embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over sexual assault allegations - a case that has since been dropped.He has remained in the embassy over fears of extradition to the US. Last week, US media reported officials were preparing charges against him.Criticism of languageEarlier this month Ms Anderson, a former Baywatch star and long-time advocate for Mr Assange, had called on the Australian government to help him."Get Julian his passport back and take him back home to Australia and be proud of him, and throw him a parade when he gets home," she told Australia's 60 Minutes programme.

Several Australian politicians backed her criticism of Mr Morrison's language, even if some disputed her views on Mr Assange's case.Labor Senator Kristina Keneally tweeted: "It's high time men, including @ScottMorrisonMP, stopped using a woman's sexuality & appearance to denigrate her political arguments."Independent Senator Derryn Hinch added that Mr Morrison "really should not have said it".One government minister, Steve Ciobo, told Australian media: "I suspect it was a statement that was said in a light-hearted way".
