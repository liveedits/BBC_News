                    US President Donald Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to retiring Utah US Senator Orrin Hatch
                
            Retiring Utah Senator Orrin Hatch and doctor, philanthropist, and humanitarian Miriam Adelson completed the list.The president called Senator Hatch "a great friend", saying: "He liked me right from the beginning and therefore I like him."Mr Trump also joked with Justice Scalia's widow, Maureen, over the size of her family. "You were very busy, wow," Mr Trump told her after naming the nine Scalia children. "I always knew I liked him."The nomination of Mrs Adelson, wife of billionaire casino magnate and Republican party donor Sheldon Adelson, drew some criticism. Public Citizen, an American public interest group told the Guardian "it was difficult to believe the decision to recognise Miriam Adelson was based on merit".Reacting to the award Mrs Adelson told reporters she was "deeply humbled and moved by this exceptional honour".Clarifying the choices, the White House claimed it had followed the example of previous administrations' processes.
