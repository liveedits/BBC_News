            Peru's former president has requested asylum at the Uruguayan embassy after being barred from leaving the country. Alan García is accused of taking bribes from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht in exchange for government contracts to build a metro line in the Peruvian capital, Lima. The two-time president denies the charges and says he is the victim of political persecution. A court banned him from leaving Peru while an investigation is carried out.'The largest foreign bribery case in history'Peru's foreign ministry confirmed Mr García had requested asylum from the Uruguayan embassy in Lima on Saturday, hours after the court order was issued.
    
        
The request "should be evaluated by the government of Uruguay", the foreign ministry said in a statement.Uruguay is yet to confirm whether it will grant Mr García asylum. The corruption allegations refer to his second term in office, between 2006 and 2011.Mr García first led the South American country from 1985 to 1990.
