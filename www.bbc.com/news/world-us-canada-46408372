        3) The exesThank U, Next has been described as an ode to all boyfriends past as it came into creation after Grande and Pete Davidson ended their engagement (read to the end if you're curious about who dumped whom). A brief history of Ariana and Pete
Pete Davidson speaks out on Ariana split
But the comedian is not the only ex to get a shout-out.In the opening part of the video, the singer name-drops four and uses the Mean Girls' infamous Burn Book to highlight her thoughts on three of them.Pete Davidson is huuuuuge - ahem - and we will leave that to you to decipher that one for yourselves.

        Big Sean is described as "so cute" and "so sweet" - and in case you can't read it, the last bit says "could still get it".

        Finally, her fourth ex, Mac Miller, who died in September from a drug overdose, is called an angel and is not given a page in the Burn Book.

            The general consensus on the net is that Grande is poking fun at the public's curiosity about her personal life by recreating the gossip sequence about ultimate mean girl Regina George.
