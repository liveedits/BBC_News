            A Geminid meteor shower has been spotted by stargazing enthusiasts from around the world. Here is a selection of your photos.The Geminid meteors are pieces of rocky debris from an extinct comet, racing round the Solar System, in an orbit.

                    "Despite the cold, I managed to capture a meteor streak," says Jonas Yip who took this scene on Lancing Beach in West Sussex, England
                
            
                
                
            
        The Geminid meteors originate from a rocky asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon, and each year, the Earth passes through a trail of debris left by the asteroid as it travels around the Sun.

        When the debris hits Earth's atmosphere they burn up, producing streaks of light known as meteors.

                    David Greer said: "I took the photo last night in Al Quadra desert in Dubai."
                
            
                
                
            
        Appearing in bursts of two or three, Geminids travel slower and burn brighter than most other meteors - creating long, glowing arcs of white, yellow, blue, red and green.
