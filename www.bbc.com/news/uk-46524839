Parliamentary authorities say the incident, which happened just before midday, is contained.Christopher Hope, a reporter for the Daily Telegraph, told BBC News: "I heard a scream and then looked out the window, and then about half a dozen police officers who appeared not to be armed were running towards a man."And then it appears the man was Tasered."It appears to be contained now. There are armed police patrolling downstairs by the Christmas tree."
