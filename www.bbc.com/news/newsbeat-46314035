Set to come out next summer, the film has huge names attached to it including Beyonce, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Seth Rogan.In the trailer we see the familiar opening moments of the story, where Rafiki presents a young Simba to the animals of the Pride Lands.It was aired during NFL's traditional Thanksgiving primetime game in the US.Here's a hit of nostalgia for you:

        The trailer racked up more than 10 million views in less than 24 hours. It suggests the new film is following the original story - although with Simba looking so clear in the trailer, some people are worried about what that means for his dad...

        It's directed by Jon Favreau, who was behind the live-action remake of The Jungle Book.Donald Glover will play Simba, Beyonce will play his love interest Nala and Chiwetel Ejiofor will play his uncle Scar. "It is a director's dream to assemble a talented team like this to bring this classic story to life," Jon said.

        But not everyone was pleased with the remake of The Jungle Book, and it looks like there are some people worried about Disney's latest attempt at re-creating a classic for a new audience.

                Is it just me or does anyone else think the CGI in these Disney remakes is going to age horribly?Don't get me wrong, the new Lion King looks impressively detailed but we're definitely knee-deep in the uncanny valley. Beast from Beauty & the Beast looked awful from day one.‚Äî Lux Noctis (@TheLuxNoctis) November 23, 2018
