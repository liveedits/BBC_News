        The trailer suggests the new film is following the original story - although with Simba looking so clear in the trailer, some people are worried about what that means for his dad...

        It's directed by Jon Favreau, who was behind the successful live-action remake of The Jungle Book.Donald Glover will play Simba, Beyonce will play his love interest Nala and Chiwetel Ejiofor will play his uncle Scar. "It is a director's dream to assemble a talented team like this to bring this classic story to life," Jon said.
