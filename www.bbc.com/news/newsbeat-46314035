Fans of the original film were pleased to hear the trailer narrated by James Earl Jones, who plays king Mufasa in both the 1994 original and next year's film.

        The trailer racked up more than 10 million views in less than 24 hours. It suggests the new film is following the original story - although with Simba looking so clear in the trailer, some people are worried about what that means for his dad...

        It's directed by Jon Favreau, who was behind the live-action remake of The Jungle Book.Donald Glover will play Simba, Beyonce will play his love interest Nala and Chiwetel Ejiofor will play his uncle Scar. "It is a director's dream to assemble a talented team like this to bring this classic story to life," Jon said.

        But not everyone was pleased with the remake of The Jungle Book, and it looks like there are some people worried about Disney's latest attempt at re-creating a classic for a new audience.

                I have such mixed feelings about The Lion King remake. My favourite film in the entire world and I’m so concerned the new version is absolutely awful.— Alex ✨ (@_sowrongitsalex) November 22, 2018

As well as The Jungle Book, Disney remade Beauty and the Beast (with Emma Watson), and Aladdin is set to be released next year.

                Is it just me or does anyone else think the CGI in these Disney remakes is going to age horribly?Don't get me wrong, the new Lion King looks impressively detailed but we're definitely knee-deep in the uncanny valley. Beast from Beauty & the Beast looked awful from day one.— Lux Noctis (@TheLuxNoctis) November 23, 2018

        Are people going to get bored of seeing their favourite stories told again and again?

                Isn’t it gonna be the same story? Same ending? I don’t get the hype. So now they gonna remake every animation? That’s just lazy— ジエシー (@bevelandembosse) November 23, 2018
