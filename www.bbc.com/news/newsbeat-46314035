        It's directed by Jon Favreau, who was behind the successful live-action remake of The Jungle Book.Donald Glover will play Simba, Beyonce will play his love interest Nala and Chiwetel Ejiofor will play his uncle Scar. "It is a director's dream to assemble a talented team like this to bring this classic story to life," Jon said.
