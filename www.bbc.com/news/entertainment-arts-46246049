                A giant. Not a 'journalist', but that wasn't the style in his day. Burnet, Day, Gall et al came along and changed all that. Richard 'Dickie' Baker was also a master of the arts, especially music about which he wrote beautifully. A true gentleman. #RIP https://t.co/kadgvvwVXQâ€” Alastair Stewart (@alstewitn) November 17, 2018
