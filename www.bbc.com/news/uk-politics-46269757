        Jacob Rees-Mogg has warned fellow Tory MPs that if they don't ditch Theresa May now she will lead them into the next election, scheduled for 2022.Few Tories thought this was a "good idea", the Brexiteer MP suggested.Mr Rees-Mogg wants to oust the PM over her EU withdrawal agreement but has so far failed to get enough colleagues to back his call for a no confidence vote.Meanwhile, ministers have had to accept Labour amendments to its Budget plans after the DUP withdrew its backing.Labour said the government was "falling apart in front of us" after ministers accepted a series of technical changes to the Finance Bill once it became clear the Democratic Unionists, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, again said they would not support the Tories.

Backlash over May's 'queue jumping' comment
A group of Brexiteer cabinet ministers, headed by Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, have been pushing for changes to the draft withdrawal agreement, to get rid of the Irish "backstop" plan, which has led to claims the UK will be tied to the EU indefinitely.Downing Street said at a meeting of the cabinet earlier, the first since a spate of Brexit resignations last week, ministers had discussed possible alternative arrangements to keep the border open, that could involve "technological solutions". Asked if parts of the withdrawal agreement could be re-negotiated, Chief Whip Julian Smith said: "There's a focus on getting the deal done."He said it was going to be a "really exciting" week as Mrs May headed to Brussels for talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker ahead of a crunch Brexit meeting of EU leaders on Sunday, which is expected to sign off on the withdrawal agreement.

But he added: "I think it is now, or the prime minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election."You find MPs privately who will say to you that they think that is a really good idea in any number and I would be quite surprised."Mrs May's allies insist she would win a no confidence vote and under Conservative rules she would then be immune from a challenge for 12 months.The PM says her Brexit deal is the best the UK can get from Brussels and will allow the country to take back control of its "money, laws and borders".Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop

Downing Street said that, during talks with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the PM had emphasised that the draft Brexit terms would give Scottish businesses the "clarity and certainty they need to protect jobs and living standards and see us take back control of our waters". The SNP leader earlier met Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to discuss tactics ahead of the Commons vote.

        Media captionTheresa May tells  Laura Kuenssberg: "Don't just listen to the politicians."The DUP abstained in Monday night's Budget votes as a warning shot over what they say are her broken promises on Brexit.After the DUP indicated they would abstain again on further votes on Tuesday, ministers accepted Labour and SNP amendments in order to avoid likely defeat.These will require the government to conduct a review into the public health impact of gaming, a report into the impact of Brexit on international tax enforcement and a review into the impact of tax avoidance measures on income inequality and child poverty. Under the terms of their House of Commons deal, agreed after Mrs May lost her Commons majority in last year's general election, the DUP is supposed to back the government on Budget matters and on confidence votes.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said their refusal to do so now was "absolutely staggering", adding that the Conservatives were "in office but not in power".
