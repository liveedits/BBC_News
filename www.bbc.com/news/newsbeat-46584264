                We can be so insensitive. God bless Kanye & Pete. Being flippant about mental illness speaks more about you than them. Stop saying the word love & live it. Love is an action.— QUEEN (@NICKIMINAJ) December 15, 2018

Pete spoke about his borderline personality disorder, which affects mood and how you interact with others, earlier this month.He wrote on Instagram: "I've spoken about BPD and being suicidal publicly only in the hopes that it will help bring awareness and help to kids like myself who don't want to be on this earth."No matter how hard the internet or anyone tries to make me kill myself. I won't. I'm upset I even have to say this."Symptoms of BPD can be grouped into four areas, according to the NHS: emotional instability, disturbed patterns of thinking, impulsive behaviour, and intense but unstable relationships. Pete's ex-fiance Ariana Grande appears to have sent a message of support to the comedian in now-deleted tweets.

                    Ariana and Pete broke up earlier this year
                
            It appears she went to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York, where Saturday Night Live is filmed, to support him."I'm downstairs and I'm not going anywhere if you need anyone or anything. I know you have everyone you need and that's not me, but I'm here too," she wrote.Ariana's ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, was found dead at his home in September after an accidental overdose involving cocaine, alcohol and an opioid drug called fentanyl.Pete and Ariana started dating in May and got engaged in June, but split up in October. Following their break-up, the native New Yorker said he'd been getting "online bullied and in public by people for nine months".Newsbeat has contacted NBC for comment.
