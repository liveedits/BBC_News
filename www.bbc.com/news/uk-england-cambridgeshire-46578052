            Police officers were left "speechless" that a driver and his passenger were uninjured when railings pierced their windscreen.The car, driven by a male who passed his test weeks ago, crashed on a frosty road near a water pumping station in Linton, Cambridgeshire, on Friday.He had a front-seat passenger and police said they were "thankfully going home to their families uninjured".BCH Road Policing advised people: "Please drive to the conditions".
