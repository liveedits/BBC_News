                Back Lane #Linton it's not often we're left speechless... The 2 occupants are thankfully going home to their families uninjured tonight. Driver only passed his test 5 weeks ago. Not all rural roads have been gritted so please drive to the conditions.351830/352023 pic.twitter.com/OExiAmkuNXâ€” BCH Road Policing (@roadpoliceBCH) December 14, 2018
