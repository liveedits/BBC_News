            They joined a smaller group of about 80 migrants who reached the border city on Sunday.Many of the smaller group are LGBTQ, media reported, who say they parted ways with the main caravan after weeks of what they call discriminatory treatment by local residents and fellow travellers. Undeterred by a harder US stance against them, the migrants have said they will continue the journey so that they can claim asylum.What is this caravan?

                    Migrants have travelled thousands of miles on foot to reach the US border
                
            The journey began from the city of San Pedro Sula in Honduras on 13 October - about 4,350km (2,700 miles) away from Tijuana.Because the route poses a host of dangers, such as attack by criminal gangs, many of the migrants say they feel safer travelling in numbers.Most previous migrant caravans have numbered a few hundred people, but after a former politician shared news of the planned caravan on Facebook, news of it quickly spread.More than 1,000 Hondurans were the first to leave, and thousands more people have joined them from neighbouring Guatemala and then Mexico.

            There is a legal obligation to hear asylum claims from migrants who have arrived in the US if they say they fear violence in their home countries.Last week however, Mr Trump signed a proclamation temporarily barring migrants who enter illegally from claiming asylum.The caravans became a campaign issue in the US mid-term elections that took place in last week, with Mr Trump warning without evidence they were full of "gang members", "hardened criminals" and even Middle Eastern "terrorists".
