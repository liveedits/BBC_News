When she was in a relationship with Eastwood she exclusively made films with him at Warner Bros, including The Gauntlet (1977), Every Which Way But Loose (1978), Bronco Billy (1980) and Any Which Way You Can (1980).

            The Tennessee-born actress also starred in the 1983 film Sudden Impact, which was the fourth film in the Dirty Harry series.The pair were together for 14 years, but in April 1989 Locke filed a lawsuit against Eastwood.In her settlement she received a $1.5m (£1.2m) three-year contract to create films for Warner Bros, but the studio did not accept any of the 30 projects she pitched.Believing this was Eastwood's doing, she again sued him in 1995 for fraud, eventually reaching a $2.5m (£2m) settlement a year later."I don't have to worry about working," she said after the settlement was made.She said the lawsuit "was never about money, it was about my fighting for my professional rights".
