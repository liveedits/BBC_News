        Staff at Radio One reportedly alerted the authorities after they were unable to contact Mr Ford when he failed to show up at work, according to the Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar.Mr Ford studied at the National Broadcasting School in London before going on to present a breakfast show on Radio Caroline, an offshore station in the UK broadcast from a ship.In an attempt to escape the "constant storms", he later found work with stations in France and Cyprus, before moving to Lebanon, where his breakfast show was said to have been the country's most popular since 1996.
