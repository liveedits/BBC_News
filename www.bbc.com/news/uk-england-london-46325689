Metropolitan Police Federation Ken Marsh recently called for officers to be given greater support, after an incident where an officer was kicked into a road, close to the path of a bus.He had previously warned of a "breakdown in society" after two officers were attacked as they tried to apprehend a suspect in Hackney.
