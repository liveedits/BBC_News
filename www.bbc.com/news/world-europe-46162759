        Media captionHow has the death of Jamal Khashoggi impacted the war in Yemen?France has said it will impose sanctions, but given no details. Also in a meeting in Paris on Saturday, Mr Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron said the Saudi authorities should shed full light on the murder, Reuters quoted French presidential sources as saying.The two leaders also warned against further destabilisation of the Middle East as a result of the affair and expressed the hope that it could create an opportunity for a resolution to the war in Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said Khashoggi's murder had "possibly" given the US and the UK a chance to put new pressure on Saudi Arabia over other issues.
