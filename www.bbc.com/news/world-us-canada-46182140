            A Republican senator from Mississippi is facing criticism for a joke she made about lynching.Cindy Hyde-Smith was filmed praising a cattle rancher, saying: "If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row."She is facing a run-off later this month against a black Democrat in a state with a history of race killings.Her opponent, Mike Espy, called the comment "reprehensible" but she says the reaction has been overblown.The video was published on Twitter on Sunday by a Mississippi blogger, and showed Ms Hyde-Smith meeting supporters.

        A spokesman for Mr Espy condemned the remarks, saying: "They have no place in our political discourse, in Mississippi, or our country.""We need leaders, not dividers, and her words show that she lacks the understanding and judgment to represent the people of our state."US mid-term results 2018: Maps, charts and analysis
