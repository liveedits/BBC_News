        MPs are debating whether to find ministers in contempt of Parliament over their decision not to release the full legal advice on the Brexit deal.Opposition parties say by limiting the information released, ministers ignored a binding Commons vote demanding they provided the full advice.Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said they had "wilfully refused to comply".Prime Minister Theresa May will later try to sell her Brexit deal to MPs, as she opens five days of debate on it.MPs will vote whether to accept or reject the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU on Tuesday 11 December. 
    
        
The deal negotiated by the UK and the EU has to be backed by a majority of MPs if it is to come into force.The legal advice rowThe government's chief legal adviser, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, published an overview of his legal advice on Monday.Senior MPs from Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, the Democratic Unionist Party, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party all signed a motion demanding immediate publication of the full and final advice.Parliament Live: Rolling updates

Putting the motion to Parliament on Tuesday, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, said what Mr Cox had told the Commons was "not legal advice" but "simply described the deal".He added: "The government is wilfully refusing to comply with a binding order of this House and that is contempt." Commons Speaker John Bercow said late on Monday there was an "arguable case" that a contempt of Parliament had been committed.

"No honourable member could say in all honesty that the attorney general has done anything other than treat this House with the greatest of respect, there can be no question that he or the government has acted in a manner which is contemptuous of this House." BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said any defeat over the legal advice would be likely to come as "an unwelcome distraction rather than a disaster" for the prime minister."While ultimately a parliamentary committee could decide to reprimand or suspend ministers, it's highly likely no sanction would be applied before next week's crucial vote on the Brexit deal," he said.The crunch debate on Brexit dealOpening what looks set to be the defining moment for her version of Brexit, Theresa May is expected to say the UK is on course for a "better future outside the EU" and that her deal "takes back control of our borders, laws and money".However, the prime minister faces opposition from MPs on all sides - including both the Leave and Remain wings of her own party - who argue that better deals could be available or that the public should have the final say in a referendum.

        Media captionThe Clerk of Legislation explains the steps of BrexitMany believe her deal is flawed because of a "backstop" that could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules in the event no future trade deal can be agreed. Some believe only the full legal advice will shed light on this.On Monday, when he published an overview of his legal advice, the attorney general said releasing the advice in full would break a longstanding convention keeping legal advice to ministers confidential, but insisted there was no cover-up, telling MPs: "There is nothing to see here." Mr Cox accepted the backstop - designed to protect Northern Ireland's peace process by preventing the return of customs posts and checkpoints on the Irish border - could leave the UK "indefinitely committed" to EU customs rules if Brexit trade talks broke down.

How MPs' Brexit debate and vote will work
What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal?
Brexit: A really simple guide
The arrangement, which would apply to the entire UK, is supposed to be temporary. However, neither side could withdraw from it without the other's consent.Mr Cox accepted that signing up to it was a "calculated risk" but added: "I do not believe we will be trapped in it permanently."How the debate will workMPs will debate different aspects of the agreement, signed last month with EU leaders after months of wrangling, before voting on 11 December, Senior ministers are being lined up to make the case for it.The first day of debate will be closed by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay
The second day, on Wednesday, will focus on security, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid opening the debate and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt closing it
Thursday's debate will be on the economy, with Chancellor Philip Hammond opening it and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox winding up
Further details have still to be announced but Mrs May will kick off proceedings by telling MPs: "The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country, whichever way we voted."

        Media captionBrexit vote: Will MPs back deal in Commons?Mrs May will argue her Brexit deal delivers on her commitments to end free movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.It will leave Britain "as a globally trading nation, in charge of our own destiny and seizing the opportunities of trade with some of the fastest-growing and most dynamic economies across the world", she will add.Mrs May will say future trade talks with Brussels will also ultimately result in "a new free-trade area with no tariffs, fees, quantitative restrictions or rules-of-origin checks - an unprecedented economic relationship that no other major economy has".Labour is threatening a vote of no confidence in the government as part of a move to trigger a general election, if Mrs May is defeated on 11 December.The party is in favour of Brexit but against Mrs May's deal, which it argues will harm industry and cost jobs. It wants to delay Brexit to negotiate a better deal with Brussels.So could Brexit legally be cancelled?The UK should be able to unilaterally cancel its withdrawal from the EU, according to a top European law officer.The non-binding opinion was delivered by the European Court of Justice's advocate general. A group of Scottish politicians has asked the court whether the UK can call off Brexit without the consent of other member states. The Court of Justice will deliver its final ruling at a later date.While the advocate general's opinions are not binding, the court tends to follow them in the majority of its final rulings.The advice from advocate general Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona was that if a country decided to leave the EU, it should also have the power to change its mind during the two-year exit process specified in Article 50 of the EU treaty.And it should be able to do so without needing the consent of the other 27 member states. As things stand the two year deadline under the Article 50 process means Brexit will happen on 29 March, 2019.
