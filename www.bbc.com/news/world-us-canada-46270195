A police spokesman said the gunman had died in an exchange of shots, but it is not clear if he took his own life.A second officer avoided injury after a bullet fired in his direction became lodged in his gun, police said.Officials say the gunman appeared to target a woman he was in a relationship with, but they do not suggest a motive.
    
        
"Chicago lost a doctor, pharmaceutical assistant and a police officer, all going about their day, all doing what they love," said Mr Emanuel. "This tears at the soul of our city. It is the face and the consequence of evil."The incident occurred at Chicago's Mercy Hospital at about 15:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Monday. "Multiple shots" were fired after the gunman opened fire in the hospital's car park, a spokesman for the Chicago Police Department said.Patients at the clinic later described hearing gunfire as the suspect made his way into the building, local media reported.The officer who was shot at but escaped injury during the incident shared images of a bullet embedded in the side of his gun, Chicago news broadcaster ABC7 reported.

Almost 13,000 people have been killed by guns so far this year in the US, according to data compiled tracking website Gun Violence Archive.They say another 25,000 have been injured and more than 250 police officers have been shot on duty.
