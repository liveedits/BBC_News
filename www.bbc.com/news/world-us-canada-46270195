A second police officer avoided injury after a bullet fired in his direction became lodged in his gun in his holster.Coins stop bullet to save soldier's lifeHospital patients scrambled to find cover under desks, police and Swat teams moved through the hospital in search of the gunman, and officers locked down hospital wings, including the nursery.Hector Avitia, who was in the hospital waiting room with his wife, told the Chicago Tribune that he tried to get people away from windows as the bullets started flying."I've heard shootings," he said. "I've known people that have died in the neighbourhood like that. But something like that? No.""He was just shooting like a maniac," he continued. "And he obviously knows how to shoot because he was holding the gun with both hands."What more do we know of the victims?Dr O'Neal was an emergency physician at Mercy Hospital on Chicago's South Side. Dr Patrick Connor, director of the hospital's emergency department, said she had been "dedicated to caring for her community - a wonderful individual".
