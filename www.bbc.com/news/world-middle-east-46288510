            A British PhD student has been sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of spying in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  Matthew Hedges, a 31-year-old academic at Durham University, denies the charge and said he was conducting research when he was arrested in Dubai on 5 May. A court in Abu Dhabi has declared him guilty of "spying for or on behalf of" the UK government.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was "disappointed" by the verdict.Click here for live updates
    
        
Mr Hunt said he had raised the case with the "highest levels of the UAE government" and the verdict "is not what we expect from a friend and trusted partner of the United Kingdom and runs contrary to earlier assurances".He also urged the UAE to reconsider the case.Mr Hunt said: "Our consular officials have been in close contact with Matthew Hedges and his family.  "We will continue to do everything possible to support him."Does UAE stability come at a price?

The BBC's Middle East reporter Paul Blake said foreign media were barred from the hearing earlier and the sentence was revealed by the family.A family spokesman said: "The hearing lasted less than five minutes and his lawyer was not present."He is said to be in a poor state of mental health, the BBC understands, and his wife Daniela Tejada has previously criticised the lack of treatment he received in prison.
