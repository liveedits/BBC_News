                    Daniela Tejada has repeatedly rejected suggestions her husband, Matthew Hedges, is a spy
                
            She said: "Matthew is innocent. The Foreign Office know this and have made it clear to the UAE authorities that Matthew is not a spy for them. "This whole case has been handled appallingly from the very beginning with no-one taking Matthew's case seriously."She said the British government "must take a stand now" and the UAE authorities "should feel ashamed for such an obvious injustice".Does UAE stability come at a price?United Arab Emirates profileMs Tejada said her husband shook his head as the verdict was delivered, adding: "I am very scared for Matt. "I don't know where they are taking him or what will happen now. Our nightmare has gotten even worse."At prime minister's questions, Tory MP Crispin Blunt told Mrs May she should make clear to the UAE that "if he is not released, I don't see why we should be committed to their defence".
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
         Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondentI was confidently expecting that we would hear some good news today because all the indications through private channels, and things I understood the family had been hearing, that the Foreign Office had been hearing, that MPs had been hearing, was that the UAE was frankly a little embarrassed about this case and wanted it over with.So no-one was expecting a sentence of life imprisonment, that has absolutely stunned everyone.

Vice-Chancellor of Durham University, Professor Stuart Corbridge said the conditions Hedges was held in "breached his human rights"."[And] this judgement has been delivered in the absence of anything resembling due process or a fair trial," he said."There has been no information given on what basis Matt was handed this sentence and no reason to believe that Matt was conducting anything other than legitimate academic research."We are committed to doing what we can to get Matt home safely and swiftly."
