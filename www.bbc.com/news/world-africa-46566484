The BBC's Ibrahim Adan in the capital, Mogadishu, says the nationality of the soldiers who were killed is not clear. Ethiopian troops, who form part of the African Union force in the country, have a base in the city.Mr Robow was a spokesman for the jihadist al-Shabab group and once served as its deputy leader before defecting last year. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab?The federal government banned him from contesting the state elections but the electoral commission gave him the go-ahead.Correspondents say he has posed a major threat to the influence of the federal government in the region.Following his arrest, a government statement said he had been organising a militia in Baidoa."These actions indicate that he never relinquished his extremist ideologies and is ready to harm the Somali people again," the statement said.Mr Robow is supported by several clans in the area and is regarded as a serious candidate for the regional election. His supporters were infuriated by his detention."This is a violation of democracy, Robow was standing in his region and his people wanted him. The government has no right to arrest him," Baidoa resident Mohamed Sheik Ali told AFP news agency.
