Price, 40, who was once said to be worth more than Â£40m, was given time to negotiate a deal with tax officials in October.At the time, lawyers for HMRC told Judge Jonathan Middleton they had been informed of a proposal by Price for an Individual Voluntary Agreement (IVA).The IVA lets people with debt repay their creditors at an affordable rate, to avoid bankruptcy.
