            A man suspected of a shooting at an Alabama shopping centre is in custody after police admitted killing the wrong man. Erron Brown, 20, handed himself in on Thursday to authorities in Georgia. Police originally believed they had shot and killed the gunman at the scene of the Thanksgiving attack at the Riverchase Galleria mall in Hoover. However, they later admitted wrongly killing Emantic Bradford Jr, 21. Mr Bradford had "heightened the sense of threat" at the scene by drawing his gun after shots rang out, police said.

According to Al.com, Mr Bradford was friends with the older victim, who was seriously injured.His family have demanded transparency about his death. Alabama police admit killing wrong man

Mr Brown was reportedly arrested at a relative's house in South Fulton county near Atlanta, in the neighbouring state of Georgia.He will be processed there before being returned to Alabama.The attack happened just before the Black Friday sales outside a footwear retailer and, according to Al.com, may have been an argument over some training shoes.

            As people fled, witnesses reported many people had their own guns out, according to NPR.When police arrived on scene, a uniformed officer saw Mr Bradford with a firearm and shot him dead, believing him to be the gunman.Police initially praised that officer as a "hero". But they later admitted their initial report was "not totally accurate".Mr Bradford's family cited witnesses as saying that he had been trying to help by waving people to safety.The unnamed officer who killed Mr Bradford during the shooting has been placed on administrative leave.
