Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Streeting said: "I know I will speak for every member of this House in expressing our deepest condolences to the family and our best wishes to the baby for a speedy recovery."Given these weapons, like the crossbow, used to kill my constituent are readily for sale online, can I urge the Prime Minister to urgently and seriously look at expanding the Offensive Weapons Bill so that we can toughen the scope of the laws governing the sale, the possession and the use of these deadly weapons."Mrs May responded by saying crossbows were "subject to strict controls", but the government would "consider the risk to public safety and whether further measures are needed".
