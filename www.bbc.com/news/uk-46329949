        Born in St John's Wood in north London in 1928, Roeg started in the film industry making tea and operating the clapper board at Marylebone Studios.His directorial debut came in 1970 when he filmed Performance, sharing the director's role with Donald Cammell.The explicit scenes of violence and drug-taking caused the film's release to be delayed by two years.
