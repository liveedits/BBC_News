            The village that's eradicated FGM
            It started when one family decided not to circumcise its women 30 years ago. That idea spread and now an entire village in Sudan has eradicated FGM; they don't even talk about it anymore.Elsewhere in the country, the majority of girls and women are cut. Now, Sudan's government, with help from British aid money, is hoping to put an end to FGM nationwide, by 2030.The BBC's Senior Africa Correspondent Anne Soy went to meet some of the people turning their back on the practice and witnessed the change they are bringing to their communities.BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year and shares their stories.
