            But when she posted images of her bandaged face on social media, her plight caught the public imagination and highlighted violence against women in Italy. She appeared on national TV, where she denounced her former boyfriend."I want you to see what he did to me. This isn't love," she said.  "While the acid ate away at my face I was on my knees praying to God to take away my beauty but at least leave me with my sight."Why Tavares' jail term has been reducedTavares, aged 30 and from Cape Verde, was convicted last year in two separate trials in Rimini to 10 years for the acid attack and eight years for stalking. The two convictions meant Tavares would serve a combined term of 18 years in jail.

            However, his defence lawyers argued that the two charges should be brought together in one case, with the aim of reducing his overall sentence. The appeal court in Bologna agreed to combine the cases and ruled that Tavares should serve 15 years, five months and 20 days.According to Italian media, Notaro's lawyer had urged the court not to lower the 18-year term but said his client was happy with the verdict."Gessica is satisfied from a human point of view and me from a judicial view," La Repubblica newspaper quoted Alberto Alessi as saying. How Notaro rebuilt her lifeNow familiar to Italians with her distinctive glittery eyepatch, Gessica Notaro has become a public symbol of the fight against violence against women.Earlier this year she took part in national TV show Dancing with the Stars and appeared on a chat show last weekend."I'm not as strong as I look," she said on Sunday. "I'm a crazy hypochondriac but when something this serious happens to you you have to choose to live or die and I chose to live."
