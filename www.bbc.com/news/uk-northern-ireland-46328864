        The UK is on the verge of making a historic mistake if it does not "junk the backstop", Boris Johnson has said.He told the DUP conference the EU had made NI an "indispensable bargaining chip" in the Brexit negotiations.DUP leader Arlene Foster said a Brexit deal that includes the backstop plan is "not in the national interest". There has been political opposition among unionists to the government's plan because of the backstop, which aims to avoid a hard Irish border.It would see only Northern Ireland stay aligned to some EU rules if it took effect.

Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop
Mr Johnson is one of two senior Conservative MPs to appear at the conference this weekend, after Chancellor Philip Hammond spoke on Friday night."We must agree that neither side will introduce a hard border in Northern Ireland. "Both governments have already been clear that they have no such intention; the commission has no such intention; the technical solutions do exist, as (EU chief negotiator) Michel Barnier has said himself, and the whole subject should be remitted to the discussion the future economic partnership where it properly belongs."'Bright side'The former foreign secretary said the UK had an "absolute duty to get this right" and that there is still time to work for a better deal."In the words of that great Northern Irish singer Van Morrison, it is time we all moved from the dark end of the street to the bright side of the road," he added, to applause. He said he hoped the DUP and Conservatives could continue working together, "backing our union against all those who would seek to divide us".Mr Johnson also suggested the creation of a secretary of state for "no deal" or World Trade Organisation terms, "with real powers across Whitehall to make things happen". "I do not believe that we will exit without a deal - that is totally unnecessary - but it is only responsible of government to make the proper preparations," he added.Mrs Foster told her party's conference that the prime minister had not been able to guarantee that the backstop would not have to be used.The government has said it is looking at alternative arrangements to ensure the backstop is a last resort.
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        But, Mrs Foster said there were "many contradictions" in the draft withdrawal agreement.She said she understood the position of many in the business community, who have urged DUP MPs to back the deal.But she added that the party could not wish away proposals that it believes are not in the best interests of Northern Ireland's economy or interests."The choice is not between this deal and no deal, despite what the government spin machine may say," she said.Ahead of the party conference, Mrs Foster warned that if the deal gets passed in parliament, her party may have to revisit its confidence-and-supply pact with the Conservatives.'Bin the backstop'On Saturday, she said "the DUP had never been afraid to say yes when it is right to do so, nor to say no when required".Earlier, the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the party would "stand firm in the face of inevitable onslaught" in opposing the government's Brexit plan.The party has repeatedly said it will not back the deal because of the backstop, which aims to avoid a hard Irish border.But, various business and farming groups in NI have urged the DUP to support the plan.Mr Dodds told the party's conference: "Prime minister - bin the backstop."

            The backstop is effectively an insurance policy that would see only Northern Ireland stay aligned to some EU rules, if it came into effect.The DUP is concerned that the backstop could threaten the integrity of the union and place a trade border down the Irish Sea.It has already threatened to vote down the government's withdrawal agreement when it comes to the Commons in a matter of weeks.Mr Dodds told the conference that the union is "non-negotiable".'Pitiful and pathetic'"In the coming days and weeks the DUP will be tried and tested like never before," he said."In such momentous times for our country, it requires strong leadership to stand up to Brussels bullying."He described Theresa May's draft plan as portraying a "pitiful and pathetic place for the United Kingdom".Mr Dodds urged the prime minister to "change course" and encouraged others to "ignore the propaganda" that it was too late for the deal to be renegotiated. The DUP holds the balance of power at Westminster, as the government relies on the votes of its 10 MPs to have a working majority in parliament.It signed a confidence and supply pact with the Conservatives in June 2017 and negotiated an extra Â£1bn in spending for Northern Ireland - but the rift between the parties over the Brexit plan has put the arrangement under significant pressure.Mr Dodds said the deal was a "two-way street", and that if the government did not uphold its commitments to the DUP to ensure the whole of the UK left the EU next March on the same terms, then the DUP would not hold its side up either."Rather than waste any more time putting forward false choices, we need the government to get on with securing a better deal," he said.GibraltarThe government has insisted that it will not renegotiate the current plan, and has urged MPs to back it or risk a no deal scenario.Mr Dodds added that the DUP wanted to leave the EU with a deal, but "not a deal at any price".

                    Philip Hammond had a series of engagements in Northern Ireland on Friday before attending the DUP conference
                
            On Friday, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, told the BBC that the government is looking at ways to provide extra assurances to the DUP over the Irish border backstop.He was speaking during a visit to an integrated school in Moira, County Down.Mr Hammond said the government has a number of choices through the "parliamentary process", which include extending the implementation period to avoid having to use the backstop."I would much prefer to see us extending the implementation period and I am sure my DUP colleagues would take the same view," he said.Mrs Foster has said if the deal does get through parliament, the DUP would have to revisit its confidence and supply deal with the Conservatives. The government of Gibraltar is also represented at the conference. Gibraltar has become involved in the Brexit debate as Spain is seeking written assurances from the UK that it will be directly consulted over its future trade negotiations with the EU which relate to Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has said his backing for the overall deal cannot be taken for granted, although no one country can block the withdrawal agreement on its own at this stage.
