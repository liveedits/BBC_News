        Local resident Travis Starling told the BBC there is currently no power or water and most radio stations are off air as aftershocks continue.Mr Starling said that at this time of year, the state sees only six hours of daylight - "We're fortunate on timing... this happened just at sunrise.""The aftershocks of the one today have been worse than any earthquake I've ever been in before," he said.
