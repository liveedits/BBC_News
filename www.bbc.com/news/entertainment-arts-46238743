Sir Lloyd Dorfman, the founder of Travelex, is no stranger to the Prince of Wales, having been chairman of The Prince's Trust since 2005.The 66-year-old donated Â£10m to the National Theatre in 2010, resulting in one of its stages, formerly the Cottesloe, being renamed in his honour. Travelex also subsidised the venue's cheap ticket scheme for 15 years.
