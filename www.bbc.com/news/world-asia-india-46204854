        People are also keeping a sharp eye out for pictures that may be shared by careless guests on their social media accounts - the couple have reportedly banned guests from posting anything about their wedding.One image - shared by singer Harshdeep Kaur was briefly up on Instagram. She deleted it, but not fast enough for screenshots to start circulating among an information-starved public.

        Details - such as the fact that Singh got on one knee and made an impassioned speech to his future wife, and that the couple have asked guests to donate to Padukone's mental wellness foundation in lieu of wedding gifts - are also being passed around frantically. Rumours that the actors were dating each other were circulating for six years, but they did not officially confirm their relationship until earlier this year.The excitement is palpable on social media:
