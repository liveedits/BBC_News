        One O2 customers, Allison Rose-Mannall, from Norwich, is an insulin-dependent diabetic who relies on her mobile and is unable to get to a landline."I'm disabled ... I'm in a wheelchair," she told the BBC. "So having no data but also no calls as well means I can't contact anyone if I have a fall or if I need anything."Lynsey Greaves runs a company in Doncaster providing home visits to the elderly and vulnerable. Her 130 staff all rely on O2 phones to access rotas, schedules, names and addresses. Since 530am she's been calling in extra office staff to give out the information for each visit over the phone. "There are nine of us trying to sort it now," she said. "It's been a nightmare."

"Remember striking up a chat with the stranger next to you on the train or the bus? "I am certainly not going to lose any sleep over losing my data for a while."Are you an 02 customer who has been affected by loss of data?
