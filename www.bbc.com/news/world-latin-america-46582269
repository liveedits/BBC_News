            "Three officers beat me. They kicked me in the leg trying to knock me down," said NÃ©stor Arce, a journalist at Confidencial.The protest came days after police raided and ransacked the offices of Confidencial, seizing computers.At the time, Mr Chamorro accused the police of behaving like criminals. He said the website would continue to denounce "the abuses of the regime".

Demonstrators in the Central American country first rallied against planned changes to the country's social security system, but the protests soon escalated to include the demand for President Ortega to resign.Mr Ortega, who has been in power since 2007, accuses the demonstrators of planning to overthrow his democratically-elected government and of inciting violence.Local human rights groups as well as the United Nations Office for Human Rights have documented alleged human rights violations which range from illegal detention to torture.
