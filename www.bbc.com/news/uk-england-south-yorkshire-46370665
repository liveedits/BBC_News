                Harry Leslie Smith will remain an inspiration to all in the Labour movement engaged in the fight for justice and fairness. The world is a far better place for his life, words and deeds; and a far sadder place with his loss. Farewell @Harryslaststand https://t.co/B5S6vRG32A— Tom Watson (@tom_watson) November 28, 2018

                Sorry for your loss John. Your father was an inspiration. As the last of them pass away, we all have to commit ourselves to follow in the footsteps of the generation that fought fascism and founded the welfare state. Rest in peace, Harry. @Harryslaststand https://t.co/4N6oz5N9U6— Billy Bragg (@billybragg) November 28, 2018
