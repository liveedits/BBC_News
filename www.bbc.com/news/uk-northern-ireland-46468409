        It is not possible to renegotiate the Irish border backstop proposal without "opening up all aspects" of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, the Irish prime minister has said.Theresa May has told MPs. she is calling off Tuesday's Commons vote.She said she would seek extra assurances from Brussels for the DUP and Brexiteers on the backstop.Ex-PM John Major has hit out at what he called the "breathtaking ignorance" of unionists opposed to the deal.The importance of being unionist?

His remarks came as Mrs May made a statement to MPs in Parliament on Monday afternoon, and said she had listened to "widespread and deep concerns" from MPs about the backstop.
    
        
It is the insurance policy aimed at avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.Mr Major warned of the dangers of violence returning in Northern Ireland, if physical checks or infrastructure were put in place at the border again after Brexit.

        Media caption'It took over a year and a half to negotiate'Speaking at the inaugural Albert Reynolds Memorial lecture in County Longford, Mr Major said it was in the economic interests of the British and Irish governments to ensure there was not a hard Brexit.Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke to Mrs May by phone on Sunday night about the deal and the planned vote.He stressed the current plan was "the only deal on the table", which took a year-and-a-half to negotiate."It is not possible to reopen any aspect of that agreement without reopening all aspects of it," he said.The Irish government has "already offered a lot of concessions along the way", which have the support of the other 26 EU member states, added Mr Varadkar.Why is Northern Ireland important in all of this?Both the EU and UK have committed to ensuring the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland remains as frictionless after Brexit as it is now.The government's deal contains the Northern Ireland protocol: the insurance policy to avoid the return of a hard border if a solution cannot be reached through a wider trade deal.Also known as the backstop, it sparked a political backlash amid claims it could lead to the break up of the United Kingdom.

        Media captionWhat will happen with the Irish border after Brexit?That is because if the backstop took effect, Northern Ireland alone would align with the EU single market in some areas, meaning new regulatory barriers between GB and NI, effectively creating an Irish Sea border.The DUP and Brexiteer MPs have vowed to reject the deal unless the backstop is ditched, because they say any differences for Northern Ireland could threaten the union and damage the economy.Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop

                I can’t follow anymore. After two years of negotiations, the Tory government wants to delay the vote. Just keep in mind that we will never let the Irish down. This delay will further aggravate the uncertainty for people & businesses. It’s time they make up their mind! #brexit— Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) December 10, 2018

The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop without EU agreement.However, Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Greens, as well as a number of business and agri-food groups, have urged Parliament to back the deal.In a statement, the leaders of those parties urged the backstop to be "banked", rather than binned, in order to protect the Good Friday peace agreement, they said.What has the DUP said?The DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds described the delay on the Brexit vote as a "shambles"."Please listen and amend the withdrawal agreement or it will be voted down," he warned Mrs May in the Commons.

                Just finished a call with the Prime Minister. My message was clear. The backstop must go. Too much time has been wasted. Need a better deal. Disappointed it has taken so long for Prime Minister to listen.— Arlene Foster (@DUPleader) December 10, 2018

The government needed to realise it was "in trouble" when it had crossed the DUP's red line relating to Northern Ireland, he added.Party leader Arlene Foster said unless changes were made to the withdrawal agreement, the deal "will not fly with the DUP".The DUP - which props up the government in a confidence-and-supply pact to give Mrs May a working majority - has been putting pressure on the government to "bin the backstop".Its MPs have already flexed their political muscle by voting against the government several times, in a bid to force the prime minister to change course.What's the latest on the backstop?Boris Johnson, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit strategy, told the BBC the backstop put the UK in a "diabolical negotiating position".Meanwhile, the government has been trying to rally support for it, with cabinet office minister David Lidington visiting Belfast last Friday, but a proposed compromise was dismissed by the DUP and Brexiteers.

        Media captionThe PM tells Radio 4's Today programme that the backstop would be part of any dealA Tory backbench amendment, which has government support, suggested MPs could be "given a role" in deciding whether to activate the backstop.It would also give the devolved administrations, particularly the Northern Ireland Assembly, more say in the process - but there has been no power-sharing executive at Stormont since 2017, when the institutions collapsed.
