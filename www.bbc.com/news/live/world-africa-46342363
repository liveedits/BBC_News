that has just closed in Kenya's capital, Nairobi,  told the BBC the event had been a great success,
but admitted they had made a mistake by allowing single-use plastic at the
venue. Ambassador Macharia Kamau said banning bottled water at the conference would have been a chance to lead the way in the fight against plastic pollution, and that it had been an oversight.The BBC's Mayeni Jones at the conference said Norway
and Canada committed hundreds of millions of dollars to improving maritime
safety, protecting sea life and reducing ocean pollution.Small island states, including Antiga and the Bahamas, pledged to ban plastic utensils and bags
within the next two years.Posted at 18:34 28 Nov18:34 28 NovNew polio vaccine 'doesn't need fridges'A polio
vaccine that can be stored as a dried powder at room temperature is a new opportunity to help eradicate the disease, researchers at the University of Southern California say.The
vaccines usually
require a cool and stable temperature to ensure the medicine remains effective.Polio has no cure
and can lead to irreversible paralysis. It mainly
affects children under the age of five, and can only be prevented by giving a
child multiple vaccine doses.It remains endemic in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan.Woo-Jin
Shin, one of the researchers involed in the
study, told the BBC’s Newsday programme that the freeze-dried polio vaccine did not need refrigeration to keep it stable and effective."The main purpose of
this project was to store the vaccine in an ambient temperature at 37C and one
at 40C and we also used commercial polio vaccines as a reference and we
compared the efficacy of the vaccine."Frozen-dried ones
worked very similar to commercial vaccines."The main objective was
to transfer the vaccine at different areas where there’s no refrigeration and second
we think that we could apply this formulation to different kinds of vaccines
and we are pretty sure that it will work."What is polio?
      Polio, or poliomyelitis, mainly affects children aged under five
    
      It is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus. It invades
the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours
    
      Initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting,
stiffness of the neck and pains in the limbs
    
      One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among
those paralysed, 5% to 10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilised
    
      Only three countries in the world have never stopped
transmission of polio: Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria.

spokesman in Free State Phaladi Shuping told South Africa's News24 website that law enforcement
agencies were hard at work with those from the UAE and India to get "more
evidence" in the quest to re-institute the charges.Posted at 18:15 28 Nov18:15 28 NovRegional troops 'end Lesotho mission'About 200 soldiers deployed a year ago

various security agencies, the government and civil society," she said, saying the mission was now complete.Posted at 17:44 28 Nov17:44 28 NovKenya MPs fail to vote on gender bill - againMercy JumaBBC Africa, NairobiKenya’s parliament
has deferred a vote on a controversial gender equity bill to 2019 as not enough
MPs turned up to vote.It is the fourth time that the vote on the bill, which
seeks to increase the number of women representatives in the National Assembly, has been stymied.Despite the constitution, which was adopted in 2010, stipulating
that no more than two-thirds of any elected or appointed body can be of the
same gender, women only hold 22% of seats in the parliament.Previous court rulings compelling parliament to implement the
legislation have failed, with female lawmakers accusing their male colleagues
of deliberately frustrating the efforts. President Uhuru Kenyatta, his deputy and other top political
leaders have urged lawmakers to support the bill.Posted at 17:31 28 Nov17:31 28 NovSomaliland delays parliamentary electionsWahiba AhmedBBC Somali serviceAFPCopyright: AFPElections in Somaliland have been subject to delay in the pastImage caption: Elections in Somaliland have been subject to delay in the pastParliamentary elections due in
the breakaway republic of Somaliland in March have been delayed until further
notice.Electoral Commissioner Abdiqadir
Iman Warsame told the BBC there were several reasons for the delay, including a
lack of funding from the international community.Donors have been concerned about recurring delays with the electoral calendar.He said the government had not provided any funds for the elections.Registration for the election
was behind because of these problems.There was also disagreement over
how many seats each region would be allocated in the next parliament, he said.Opposition parties are demanding Mr Warsame's resignation and want the other members of the official election committee to be replaced.Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991.The move followed a secessionist struggle during which Siad Barre's forces pursued rebel guerrillas in the territory. Tens of thousands of people were killed and towns were flattened.Though not internationally recognised, Somaliland has a working political system, government institutions, a police force and its own currency.Read: Making a success of 'independence'Posted at 17:06 28 Nov17:06 28 NovKenya gay rugby player 'granted bail'PHILLIP ROGERSONCopyright: PHILLIP ROGERSONKenneth Macharia says he will be persecuted for being gay if he is deported to KenyaImage caption: Kenneth Macharia says he will be persecuted for being gay if he is deported to KenyaA gay rugby player from Kenya, who is facing deportation

parliament on Tuesday to explain why, during a recent radio interview, he had accused some MPs of
taking bribes to allow for the unlawful printing of the money.But he failed to show up, so House Speaker Bhofal Chambers has

When a member of the IMF wants to take on debt ... it has to discuss that with the IMF," he added.Russia has built up security and business ties with CAR in the last few years.
