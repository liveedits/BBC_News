him in court or forfeit their money, AFP reports."I want you to go out to look for Nnamdi Kanu, I gave you a Nnamdi Kanu and 
you have lost him and I'm not happy with you. I want him back," she is quoted as saying.Posted at 17:42 14 Nov17:42 14 NovZimbabwe city considers mandatory cremationZimbabwe’s second city Bulawayo is considering mandatory cremation for
people who die aged 25 and below because of a shortage of burial space in the
city, the state-run Chronicle newspaper reports.Bulawayo City Council debated the contentious issue at a recent meeting, the paper quotes the
minutes as saying.One of the city’s six cemeteries – West Park Cemetry – only had space
for 200 graves, it said.The Chronicle
says city residents have opposed the idea of cremation in the past, saying
it was "unAfrican".In
Bulawayo, it costs about $63 (£49) to cremate a body, while conducting a burial
without a funeral policy is about $1,000, the report says.Posted at 17:41 14 Nov17:41 14 NovTeachers whipped by jihadists in Burkina FasoSimon GongoBBC Afrique, OuagadougouAFPCopyright: AFPJihadists wants schools in northern Burkina Faso to abandon secular educationImage caption: Jihadists wants schools in northern Burkina Faso to abandon secular educationSchools in Burkina Faso near the
borders with Mali and Niger are coming under increasing threat from jihadist
groups demanding the schools abandon secular education. On Monday, four armed men on
motorbikes pulled up to a school in the small northern community
of Toulfé. Burkina Faso's Minister of Education
Stanislas Ouaro told BBC Afrique the gunmen forced everyone on to the floor
before whipping four of the teachers and the school director in front of the
students. The director got six lashes and
each teacher got two, he said. The gunmen reportedly introduced
themselves as Ansarul Islam members, an extremist group launched in 2016
by Malam Dicko and considered active in the northern part of the
country. Meanwhile, a public
school closed this week in the eastern town of Gayeri, after teachers
reported seeing a threatening message written in French on an
announcements board of the school. "We will come back on 14 November
to empty the school of its students. If we find a teacher, he is dead," the threat read, according to the education minister who spoke to the
teachers.The minister told the BBC more than
560 schools had not been operational in border areas since October as teachers had fled or not shown up to work because of security concerns.Posted at 17:24 14 Nov17:24 14 NovLibya 'will extradite' Manchester bomber's brotherBBC World ServiceLibyan Interior MinistryCopyright: Libyan Interior MinistryLibya had said last year that Hashem Abedi would face trial at homeImage caption: Libya had said last year that Hashem Abedi would face trial at homeLibya's prime minister says his country expects to extradite to the UK the brother of the Manchester bomber before the end of this year.Twenty-two people died in the suicide bombing at a concert at the Manchester Arena 18 months ago.

against Eritrea is the latest in a series of dramatic developments in the Horn
of Africa. They were imposed in 2009 after
Eritrea was accused of supporting the Somali jihadist group al-Shabab.But the UN Security Council has adopted a resolution after UN monitors found there was no longer evidence Eritrea was backing the militants.Until a few months ago,
Eritrea was a global pariah - some even called it “Africa's North Korea”.A politically repressive
closed state, Eritrea has been a major source of migrants to Europe.Change started when a
new prime minister came to power in Ethiopia, a close ally of the West.Abiy Ahmed spearheaded a
peace deal with Eritrea after two decades of hostilities.Getty ImagesCopyright: Getty ImagesEthiopia's Abiy Ahmed (left) brokered peace with Eritrea's Isaias Afwerki a few months agoImage caption: Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed (left) brokered peace with Eritrea's Isaias Afwerki a few months agoBut Eritrea will have now to step up.It can no longer use enmity with its powerful neighbour or UN sanctions as an excuse for a near complete lack of political freedom, indefinite national service and a refusal to hold elections.Read: Behind the smiles of Eritrea's presidentPosted at 15:51 14 Nov15:51 14 NovSuper Eagles offered $25,000 for SA goalsThe governor of Nigeria’s

Red List.However, the primates, who

still remain “endangered”.When the list was last
put together by the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2008, the mountain gorilla population was
estimated to be around 680.IUCN says over the
last decade estimates show that the population has increased to more than 1,000,the highest figure ever recorded.This is thanks to conservation
measures, including anti-poaching and veterinary patrols, and
“positive engagement from communities” living around their protected habitat covering
approximately 792 sq km (305 sq miles).IUCN's Liz Williamson cautioned that such efforts had to be maintained:Quote Message: Whilst it is fantastic news that mountain gorillas are increasing in number, this subspecies is still Endangered and therefore conservation action must continue."

His letter is circulating on social media.On Monday, Ethiopia’s Attorney General Berhanu Tsegaye announced that vast corruption had been unveiled at Metec after a five-month investigation.He said Metec had made foreign purchases, totalling $2bn (£1.5bn), without any bidding processes.As a result, 27 officials of the firm are now under arrest, he added.

Neither Maj Gen Kinfe nor officials at Metec have commented on the allegations.The arrests are the biggest crackdown on corruption in Ethiopia, which is undergoing massive reforms since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power seven months ago.In August, Mr Abiy took away work contracted to Metec to build Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam - a massive infrastructure project to dam the Nile River - and gave it to foreign firms.

in the Nigerian state of Lagos are now allowed to wear a hijab to school, the
authorities have said.The
Muslim headscarf has been at the centre of a row in the state since 2014 when a
Lagos high court banned them in schools.The decision was overturned on appeal two years later, but the state then took the case to the Supreme Court and did not lift the ban at school, the Daily Trust reports.In a
circular, the state government said it would now allow girls to wear hijabs pending the
Supreme Court ruling.It
stipulated that a student’s hijbab had to be “short, smart, neat and in the same colour of the uniform”."No student should be discriminated against in any form on the basis of religion," it added.Saheed Ashafa, from the Muslim Students’ Society of Nigeria (MSSN) in Lagos State, welcomed the move, the Vanguard newspaper reports.He condemned “the embarrassing way and manner that our
members are being victimised, harassed, punished and denied entrance into their
classrooms for wearing Hijab”.The decision comes days after a school in nearby Oyo state
closed after refusing to allow students to enter the school premises wearing hijabs.This sparked protests by parents which had led to the
closure of The University of Ibadan International School.Nigeria's population is roughly divided between Muslims and Christians.The majority of Muslims live in the north and Christians primarily are in the south - though  Lagos has a religiously mixed population.Read: Nigeria's war of religious robesPosted at 10:27 14 Nov10:27 14 NovSA pink diamond fetches record priceAFPCopyright: AFPThe diamond's new owners have rechristened it the Winston Pink LegacyImage caption: The diamond's new owners have rechristened it the Winston Pink LegacyA rare pink diamond has fetched 50.3m Swiss francs ($50m; £38.5m) at auction, a record price per carat.Pink Legacy, weighing in at just under 19 carats, was bought by US brand Harry Winston at auction in the Swiss city of Geneva.The rectangular-cut stone was found in a South African mine around 100 years ago and has likely not been altered since it was first cut in 1920, the auction house Christie's said.Finding a fancy vivid pink diamond larger than 10 carats is virtually unheard of, the auction house said.The price of around $2.6m per carat marked a world record for a pink diamond, according to the Europe head of Christie's.It had been valued at between $30-$50m before sale, and was bought after only five minutes of bidding.The diamond's new owners have rechristened it the Winston Pink Legacy.Read the BBC News story for morePosted at 9:27 14 Nov9:27 14 NovZimbabwe marks one year since coupAnalysisAndrew HardingBBC NewsGetty ImagesCopyright: Getty ImagesTanks began moving towards Harare on 14 November 2017, taking up positions on the streets the following dayImage caption: Tanks began moving towards Harare on 14 November 2017, taking up positions on the streets the following dayIt is a year since Zimbabwe’s army staged a coup to force
President Robert Mugabe out of power. One year on, and the country is still wrestling with his 37-year legacy.His successor, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has won a disputed
election and the authorities insist they are making progress to end the
country’s political isolation and a long economic slump.The government is promising a new era of transparency and
accountability, and what it calls painful reforms to balance the national
budget.That means new taxes, privatisation, and drastic cuts to the
civil service wage bill. But many Zimbabweans are sceptical. The local currency has
collapsed in value, sending prices for many basic goods soaring.And there are real concerns that the governing Zanu-PF –
still stacked with feuding members of Mr Mugabe’s old regime – is simply not up
to the task of transforming the country and reviving its shattered economy.Still, Zimbabwe is a calmer, less fearful place right now.Read: No cash, no bread, no KFCPosted at 9:27 14 Nov9:27 14 NovCall to control meningitis in AfricaAnne SoyBBC senior Africa correspondentAFPCopyright: AFPThe paper calls for wider vaccination programmes across the "meningitis belt"Image caption: The paper calls for wider vaccination programmes across the "meningitis belt"African
governments are being urged to do more to control meningitis, especially in the
region that stretches from Senegal in the West to Ethiopia in the East. A
paper published in the medical journal, Lancet Neurology, found that while
significant progress had been made towards controlling the disease worldwide,
the so-called “meningitis belt” in sub-Saharan Africa was lagging behind.Last year, some 18,000 cases were reported in Nigeria and Niger.The
contagious disease, which can cause brain damage, blindness and deafness, can
be controlled with vaccines.The Meningitis Research Foundation proposes the development of
cheaper and more broad-based vaccines and the reduction in cost of diagnostic tests
and treatments.Posted at 9:07 14 Nov9:07 14 NovUN to lift sanctions on EritreaGetty ImagesCopyright: Getty ImagesThe Eritrean government says it wants compensation after nine years of sanctionsImage caption: The Eritrean government says it wants compensation after nine years of sanctionsDiplomats at the United Nations say
they expect the Security Council to vote unanimously later on Wednesday to lift
the sanctions against Eritrea.It comes amid a thawing of relations
in the region and a landmark peace deal with neighbouring Ethiopia.The sanctions were imposed nine
years ago over the country’s alleged support of al-Shabab Islamist miltants in Somalia.A draft resolution proposed by the
UK recognises that UN monitors have failed to substantiate the allegations.Adoption of the resolution would
immediately lift the arms embargo, targeted asset freeze and travel ban
imposed on Eritrea.The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza says Eritrea sits on a strategic point on the Red Sea that connects Europe,
Africa and the East, but its economy has been badly affected by years of
sanctions.The Eritrean government says it wants compensation for the punitive
measures which it calls unjustified and politically motivated, he says.But critics say the country has done little to address human
rights abuses from within and, in particular, the indefinite national service
conscription that has led to tens of thousands of young Eritreans fleeing the
country towards Europe.Ethiopia’s ambassador to
the UN, Taye Atske Selassie, said the end of sanctions would "definitely open up a
lot of possibilities for Eritrea," drawing foreign investors
and bringing Asmara back into the international fold, the AFP news agency
