        Many say they are fleeing gang violence in their home towns and want to apply for asylum based on "credible fear", while others are hoping for better job opportunities in the US. Applying for asylum at a border post can take months and with US officials restricting the number of applicants to between 40 and 100 a day at El Chaparral port of entry in Tijuana, the migrants could be stuck for months or even years in the shelter.

        Media captionWhy are there so many people at US border?Some of those jumping the fence said they hoped their cases would be heard more quickly that way.US President Donald Trump has lashed out at the migrants, calling them an "invasion", which he said threatened to "overrun" the US.He has sent troops to the border and issued an order denying the possibility of asylum to migrants crossing the southern border illegally - but that order has since been halted by a US federal judge.A previous attempt by a larger group of migrants to jump over the border wall was met with tear gas, sending women and children running back to the Mexican side.Mexico has demanded that the US investigate the use of tear gas during the incident. The migrants who stormed the border were deported by Mexico.All pictures subject to copyright.
