            All three players involved and the South Africa squad were warned by police, but escaped any sanction. A Hilton Hotel statement read: "At 2pm on Friday, November 23, there was an incident where our housekeeping team discovered a suspicious package in one of the bedrooms. "She notified hotel management and, as per our protocol, we evacuated bedrooms above and below the floor in question and contacted the police immediately."Rugby stars support Gareth Thomas with rainbow laces

It added that - following an investigation - the all-clear was quickly given. The South African rugby union declined to comment, saying it was a hotel matter. But after the game, coach Rassie Erasmus said: "We didn't have the best preparation and we had a couple of pre-match blows with injuries, but we can't use them as excuses."In a statement, South Wales Police said: "Officers were called to reports of a suspicious item at the Hilton Hotel in Cardiff city centre shortly after 2.15pm on Friday, November 23. "After initial investigation work was carried out, it was established the item was not suspicious."
