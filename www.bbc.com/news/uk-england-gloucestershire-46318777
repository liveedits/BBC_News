            Mr Beastall says he has now had considerable interest from TV and film production companies around the world, with one firm even offering to fly him out to Canada for a meeting."To go viral is a dream come true. I'm so pleased with the reaction. If opportunities do come from it I will be delighted," he said. "It's really difficult to be noticed in this industry. I feel like I can do really good work and until now no one was seeing it." Mr Beastall said he had been inspired by the first John Lewis Christmas advert in 2007.Since then the department store chain's sentimental television advertising campaigns have become something of an annual UK tradition.

            Mr Beastall said: "The first John Lewis advert is still my favourite, and told a good, honest story. "When I saw this year's one I appreciated it, but I wonder whether the heart has been lost in comparison to the first advert they released."Mr Beastall said of the three or four films he has produced so far, Love is a Gift is the one he is most proud of. He said: "People who have lost loved ones have said watching my film has helped them, and it's why I made it - to make people feel happy."
