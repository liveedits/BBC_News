            Donald Trump has met China's President Xi Jinping for nearly two and a half hours in their first talks since a trade war erupted earlier this year.Mr Trump had said he hoped to reach a deal to defuse trade disagreements during the working dinner after the G20 summit in Buenos Aires.Meanwhile G20 leaders have agreed a joint declaration for the summit.The document notes divisions over trade but does not criticise protectionist activity.There was no immediate comment after the dinner but during the meeting the Chinese leader said co-operation was the best choice for their nations, state news agency Xinhua reports.
