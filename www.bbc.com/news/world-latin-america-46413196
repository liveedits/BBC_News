            Donald Trump is to meet China's President Xi Jinping after the G20 summit in their first talks since a trade war erupted earlier this year.Mr Trump said he hoped they would reach a deal during their dinner in Buenos Aires to defuse trade disagreements and said he believed Beijing wanted this.A Chinese official meanwhile said "consensus is steadily increasing" but differences remained.Both sides have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods.On Friday Mr Trump briefly met Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the G20, a Russian official told Reuters.

        Media captionSo how does a G20 summit work?During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, Mr Xi took a swipe at the US's America First policy by saying that countries that embraced protectionism were "doomed to failure".Ahead of the G20 Mr Trump told US media he expected to go ahead with plans to raise tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods - first introduced in September - to 25% (up from 10%) starting in January 2019.Mr Trump also said that if talks were unsuccessful, he would carry out a threat to hit the remaining $267bn of annual Chinese exports to the US with tariffs of 10-25%.
