                    The picture of the clash between Theresa May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker is used on a number of Saturday's front pages. "May threatens to crash Brexit deal after summit showdown," is the headline on the FT Weekend, which says the PM had a "frank confrontation" with the EU in Brussels.

                    "Why the hell do we bother?" says the Daily Express. It says the "bust-up in Brussels" shows the EU's "disdain for Britain's Brexit wishes". The paper says Mr Juncker was accused of showing "disrespect" to Britain after the "furious" bust-up with Mrs May.

                    The Daily Telegraph says Mrs May had a "public war of words" with Mr Juncker after criticism that "left a cloud" over the Brussels summit. "I've been very clear: don't call me nebulous," is the paper's headline.

                    "Angry and bruised, May returns empty-handed," says the Guardian. It reports that the PM's failure to achieve "any kind of breakthrough" leaves her "brutally exposed". EU officials tell the paper that plans to work over Christmas to get a legal guarantee on the temporary nature of the backstop have hit a brick wall.

                    A majority of the cabinet view Mrs May's Brexit deal as dead, says the Times. It reports that other options - including a second referendum - are being discussed. The paper says it comes after the PM faced "fresh humiliation" in Brussels. Like many of the front pages, the Times features a picture of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their family at their Norfolk home - revealed as their Christmas card photo.

Some stores have slashed prices by 80%, the paper says, calling them "panic sales" in its headline.

            "Why the hell do we bother?" is the headline in the Daily Express, next to a photograph of a heated exchange between European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and UK PM Theresa May in Brussels.According to the Daily Telegraph, the pair had a public war of words that left a cloud over the EU summit.The Financial Times says the prime minister has threatened to crash the Brexit deal unless other EU leaders agree to discuss changes to help her sell it at Westminster.    Mrs May has returned home angry, bruised and empty handed, according to the Guardian.The Times says her deal is dead and the cabinet is split over how to proceed - with one group leaning towards another referendum, another backing a softer Norway-style deal and a third willing to risk leaving without a deal.

        The Times says they display the couples' "wildly different styles", which are summed up by the Daily Telegraph as the "relaxed family" and the "Hollywood love match".The Telegraph points out Prince William's "daringly" unbuttoned shirt in his picture of "rural normality" with his family in Norfolk.The Sun's royal photographer Arthur Edwards says people will look at it and feel the Royal Family's future is in safe hands.The Daily Mirror says Meghan and Harry's card - with a black and white image, taken from behind them as they watch fireworks at their wedding - couldn't be more different and "oozes Hollywood glamour".

It shows him leaping from behind the "Ed-stone" - on which Labour carved its 2015 election promises - but with the words changed to quote David Cameron's tweet offering a choice between "stability and strong government" or "chaos with Ed Miliband ". "At least someone is enjoying themselves", the paper says.
