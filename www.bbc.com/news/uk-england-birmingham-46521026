The Marco Polo ship had left Tilbury in Essex on 5 November and travelled to the West Indies and Azores with 610 passengers and 294 crew on board.
    
        
The couple were arrested on 4 December following a tip-off from the UK National Crime Agency. They appeared before a judge and will be held separately while a joint Portuguese and British investigation continues.A spokesman for the operator said the firm "does not tolerate any criminal activity or anti-social behaviour on board its ships".
