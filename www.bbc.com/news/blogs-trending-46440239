            Chrissy Teigen has posted a picture of her son wearing a helmet for the first time. On Instagram the model wrote: "My baby bug got his head shaping helmet today! Please don't feel bad for him if you see photos. He is a happy bug and we're just fixing his flat." The helmets are used to treat plagiocephaly and brachycephaly or flat head syndrome.The image of Miles has received more than than 1.1 million likes and has prompted many parents to share pictures of their own children wearing helmets in a show of solidarity, including little Colton.

            Flat head syndrome is common and affects one in every five babies born. According to the NHS a baby's skull can be relatively soft and can change shape if constant pressure is applied. Consultant Paediatrician Donald Macgregor, from NHS Tayside, said helmets hold parts of the skull firm leaving space for other parts to grow. According to Great Ormond Street Hospital the use of helmets as a treatment is "controversial" and we don't know for sure how effective they are. That said, Melissa was happy with the results their son gained from using a helmet.

                Every time I see a baby in a helmet, I think they have good parents who love their baby so much. Parenting is hard and these little blips can make you stressed. Thank you for posting and helping other parents see how common babies in helmets are.— Jennifer (@jray1000) December 4, 2018
