            Escaped ponies roam in rush hour Hellesdon traffic
            About 30 ponies were spotted roaming busy roads during a morning rush hour.They escaped from a nearby field in Hellesdon, near Norwich, early on Thursday, and drivers on Reepham Road were forced to stop to let them pass.A local farmer helped to return them safely to the Hillside Animal Sanctuary.The charity said it was unsure how the animals managed to get out of a locked field but they had only walked a short distance.It said the ponies are from the cob breed that "tend to stick together".
