                    Casamonica clan members were evicted by police
                
            Ms Raggi said the villas, in the Quadraro district, violated Rome's construction and landscape laws and some "incorporated whole sections of the historic Felice Aqueduct". She is in the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), which is ruling Italy in coalition with the League."Today is an historic day for the city of Rome and for Romans," she said. "We are putting an end to years of illegality and are sending a strong statement to the Casamonica clan."

            Mayor under fireOn Saturday a judge cleared Ms Raggi of accusations that she had lied over a senior appointment in her office. She had been accused of false testimony in connection with Renato Marra, nominated to head the Rome tourism department. Prosecutors had sought a 10-month prison sentence for her.She has faced much criticism over Rome's creaking infrastructure, including serious problems with waste disposal. She said the Casamonica villas had been built 30 years ago and symbolised the authorities' "impotence in the face of mobsters". She said it was the most impressive operation ever by the capital's police force against the Rome mafia.Police have also conducted several raids this year against properties run by the Spada mafia clan in Ostia, a seaside suburb of Rome.
