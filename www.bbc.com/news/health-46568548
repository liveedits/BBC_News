        Media captionThe current outbreak is the deadliest since Ebola was discovered in 1976It is a viral illness that kills between 30%-50% of the people it infects
Initial symptoms include sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat
Subsequent stages are vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases - internal and external bleeding
Ebola infects humans through close contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, fruit bats and forest antelope
People are infectious as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus, which can be for up to seven weeks after they recover

        'Concerning'The Ebola outbreak in the country is now the second largest in history. The latest figures show there have been 515 cases and 303 deaths.Since October, there have been around 33 people diagnosed every week and children and women have been disproportionately affected.The World Health Organization says the situation in the country is "concerning" and there remains a "very high risk" of the outbreak spreading further.

            It has been able to use new tools that have not been available in previous outbreaks.Nearly 45,000 people have been given an Ebola vaccine and for the first time multiple experimental Ebola drugs are being trialled in the midst of an outbreak. But efforts to contain the virus have been hampered by conflict in the region with more than one million people displaced from their homes and refugees moving to neighbouring countries.Armed groups have made it challenging for healthcare workers to do the basics of managing an outbreak, including tracing people who may have come into contact with infected individuals. And health officials are also trying to deal with three separate outbreaks of polio, as well as outbreaks of cholera and malaria. Surrounding countries are preparing for cases spilling over the border. Uganda has already begun vaccinating health care workers and South Sudan is set to start.Follow James on Twitter
