        The UK would be "indefinitely committed" to EU customs rules if Brexit trade talks broke down, the chief law officer has said.But Geoffrey Cox said it would not be in either side's political interests to allow that to happen.The attorney general said it was a "calculated risk" and "I do not believe we will be trapped in it permanently".Labour accused him of "hiding" the full legal advice on the Brexit deal "for fear of the political consequences".It came after Mr Cox published an overview of his legal advice on Brexit, which he described to MPs as a "commentary".
    
        
Ministers are under pressure to publish the full advice, with Labour warning of a "constitutional crisis".Sam Gyimah, who quit the government on Friday, said releasing the full advice was "key to restoring trust in politics".MPs voted last month to require the government to lay before Parliament "any legal advice in full".Live: Attorney General's statement

His statement to the House of Commons will be followed by five days of debate on the proposed Brexit deal, which will get under way on Tuesday.The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March, 2019. The UK and the EU have agreed a detailed plan for how Brexit happens, with a draft outline of how they want the future relationship to work.But the plan has to be backed by both the UK and EU parliaments before 29 March, if the UK is to leave under these terms. If it is not ratified then the UK would be on course to leave the EU without any deal - although a delay to Brexit to allow either a renegotiated deal or a further referendum have been floated as alternatives.
