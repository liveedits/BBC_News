            A Paris court has jailed a fake taxi driver for eight months for demanding that a Thai couple pay €247 (£219; $281) for a trip from the airport. The tourists' video of their argument with him went viral on YouTube. A ride from Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport to central Paris usually costs €45-55.The couple offered to pay him €200 provided he let them out. Identified only as Enock C, the driver was found guilty of fraud and extortion involving threats.In the video he claimed to be working for a private taxi service - known as VTC in French - called Chauffeur Privé. 
    
        
As he insisted on payment of €247 the Thai couple urged him to unlock the rear doors and let them out at a police station.'Pay me!'When the Thai man, Charkrid Thanhachartyothin, asked to see his licence the driver showed them a document. But when questioned in court about the taxi fare the driver said "I know nothing about that, I'm not a taxi."Le Parisien news website said the VTC drivers' network confirmed that Enock C was not VTC-registered.In the video on YouTube the driver got aggressive towards the Thai tourists when they offered him €180. "You pay me 200 euros!" he shouted, "you pay me!"Tonnes of miniature Eiffel Towers seized

In a post on 9 November under the video Mr Charkrid wrote that "the fraud taxi attacked on my phone which bumped into my face while I was trying to take a photo". "He was driving around while fast while we were calling the police. After an unsuccessful negotiation, and take a lot of time, we are tired and decided to pay him 200 euros to get out. (He locked the door) and we finally can get out."
