        Media captionStan Lee talks about some of his most loved charactersWho was Stan Lee?Lee was born in 1922 to working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania. He began working at the comics section of Timely Publications - a company that would eventually transform into Marvel Comics - and became comics editor there at age 18.But for years Lee wrote only simple comics focusing on crime stories, horrors and westerns aimed at young readers. At age 40, Lee decided to give up on comics. But his wife Joan urged him to create the characters he always wanted to write as his comic swansong.And in 1961, Lee and artist Jack Kirby created the Fantastic Four - compelling characters with individual personalities and relatable problems. Timely Publications was renamed Marvel and the golden age of comic books had begun.

            Many Marvel characters were groundbreaking at the time. For example, Black Panther was one of the first black superheroes featured in a mainstream US comic.Lee was also known for giving artists their due credit. Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right.In its heyday, Marvel sold 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.What are your memories of Stan Lee?
