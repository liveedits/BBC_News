                We’ve lost a creative genius. Stan Lee was a pioneering force in the superhero universe.

        Who was Stan Lee?Lee was born in 1922 to working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania. He began working at the comics section of Martin Goodman's Timely Publications - a company that would eventually transform into Marvel Comics - and became comics editor there at age 18.But for years Lee wrote only simple comics focusing on crime stories, horrors and westerns aimed at young readers.Aged 40, he decided to give up on comics. But his wife Joan urged him to create the characters he always wanted to write as his comic swansong.And in 1961, Lee and artist Jack Kirby created the Fantastic Four - compelling characters with individual personalities and relatable problems. Timely Publications was renamed Marvel, and the golden age of comic books began.

                    Black Panther (portrayed in film by actor Chadwick Boseman, right) was one of the first black mainstream superheroes in America
                
            Many Marvel characters were groundbreaking at the time. For example, Black Panther was the first black superhero featured in a mainstream US comic.Other characters he created include the Silver Surfer, the X-Men, Iron Man and Doctor Strange.Lee was also known for giving artists their due credit. Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romita and others achieved cult status in their own right.In its heyday, Marvel sold 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel's covers.
