        Media captionStan Lee talks about some of his most loved charactersWho was Stan Lee?Lee was born in 1922 to working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania. He began working at the comics section of Timely Publications - a company that would eventually transform into Marvel Comics - and became comics editor there at age 18.But for years Lee wrote only simple comics focusing on crime stories, horrors and westerns aimed at young readers. At age 40, Lee decided to give up on comics. But his wife Joan urged him to create the characters he always wanted to write as his comic swansong.And in 1961, Lee created the Fantastic Four.
