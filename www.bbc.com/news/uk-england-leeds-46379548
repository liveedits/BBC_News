            The first video, showing the boy being dragged to the ground before water is poured into his face, was filmed during a lunch break on 25 October, West Yorkshire Police said.His father, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the BBC the attack had left his son "very tired psychologically"."Because of what happened in the video my son is shattered," he said. "He is not concentrating on his studies. When he is asleep he wakes up saying they want to beat me up."In an interview with ITV News, the boy said he had been left "feeling like I couldn't study or do my homework".In a letter sent to parents, headteacher Trevor Bowen said: "The safety and welfare of students is our number one priority and I can assure you that this situation is being taken extremely seriously."An online fundraising page set up to help the 15-year-old boy and his family has so far raised more than Â£100,000.
