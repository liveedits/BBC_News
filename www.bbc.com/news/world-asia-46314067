            At least 10 people have died after an explosion tore through a mosque in Afghanistan's eastern Khost province.The building was inside an Afghan army base in Mandozai district, where soldiers were offering Friday prayers.A spokesman for the 2nd Regiment of the Afghan National Army said 15 people had been wounded at around 13:30 Kabul time (09:00 GMT).Reuters reports that the dead may number at least 26 and the injured more than 50, citing officials.The blast comes just three days after a suicide attack on religious scholars killed at least 50 people and wounded at least 83 in the Afghan capital.
