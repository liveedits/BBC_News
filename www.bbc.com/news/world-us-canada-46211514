            The director of the US emergency agency says a California town ravaged by wildfire will need a "total rebuild" job that will take several years.Brock Long, administrator of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), said the damage to Paradise was "one of the worst disasters" he had ever seen.So far 48 people have been found dead in the Camp Fire that hit the town, but more than 100 more remain missing.About 9,000 firefighters are currently battling wildfires across the state.At a news briefing on Wednesday by officials, the director of California's fire service said "progress is being made" to contain the blazes.
    
        
"I want to just reiterate we continue to have a lot of work to do we will continue to be here, we will get this done until the job is over," Ken Pimlott said.

Governor Brown, who was touring the area on Wednesday, described it as looking like a "war zone"."Paradise had done a lot of pre-planning for just this kind of an emergency but the fire of course was unprecedented, overwhelming and so a lot of people got caught," he said.

            The Woolsey Fire is still burning across more than 97,000 acres but is 47% contained, the state fire service tweeted. Some areas affected are now considered safe, and the Los Angeles County police say they will now allow some people back into the city of Calabasas.The smaller Hill Fire, is 94% contained in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles. A new wind-driven fire began menacing San Bernardino County homes on Tuesday - but that has been being largely contained by local officials.
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        Why are the fires burning?Officials have not yet confirmed what started any of the blazes.Several people have already filed a lawsuit against Pacific Gas & Electric.On Monday, the California Public Utilities Commissions (CPUC) announced investigations into PG&E and another electric company, Southern California Edison (SCE).SCE had reported issues with transmission lines near the start of the Hill and Woolsey Fires in southern California.Historically, California's "wildfire season" started in summer and ran into early autumn but experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment.Speaking on Wednesday, Governor Brown said a range of factors were behind worsening fires in the state. "It's not one thing, its people, it's how people live, its where they live, and it's the changing climate, the drought, the diminishing moisture and the truth is â€¦ we're going to have more difficulties," he said.
