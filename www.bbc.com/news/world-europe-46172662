Opposition parties boycotted the event.It comes as French President Emmanuel Macron urged world leaders marking the centenary of the World War One Armistice to reject nationalism.Poland's National Independence Day commemorates the restoration of the country's sovereignty from the Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian empires in 1918.

            President Duda had said he wanted the march to be a proud and joyful celebration and warned that anyone carrying offensive banners or chanting the types of slogans heard at last year's event - such as "Pure Poland, white Poland" - would be dealt with by the police.Sunday's events were said to have been peaceful and there were no reports of offensive banners or chanting.

            Last week, a Polish court overturned a ban on nationalists marching in Warsaw."We're victorious," said the organisers of the annual event, which is partly organised by the far-right National Radical Camp (ONR) and has been marked by violence in recent years.The march is also popular with thousands of ordinary, patriotic Poles, including supporters of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party. An estimated 60,000 people took part in the event last year.
