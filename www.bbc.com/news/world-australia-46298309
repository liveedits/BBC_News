        Media captionGiant dust storm turns skies orange in south-east AustraliaA giant dust storm has blanketed communities across south-east Australia, turning skies orange and raising concerns about air quality.Authorities issued a public health alert for Sydney on Thursday as the 500km-wide (310 miles) dust band reached the city and caused flight delays.Many regions elsewhere in New South Wales (NSW) have had poor visibility.Authorities said the storm was driven by strong winds picking up dry soil.  The problem has been exacerbated by a drought that has affected the entire state of NSW since August, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.

            Paramedics said dozens of people had reported breathing or asthma difficulties on Thursday, but the number affected by dust was not immediately clear.In Sydney, the dust darkened skies and caused "hazardous" air quality readings in some suburbs. Health officials urged locals to stay indoors, particularly children, older people and those with respiratory problems.
