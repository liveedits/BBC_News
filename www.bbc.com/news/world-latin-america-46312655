Judges praised the structure, designed by architects Aleph Zero and Rosenbaum, for its "humble heroism". Gustavo Utrabo, an architect at Aleph Zero, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the building was "improving the quality of life of the kids"."We tried to make a new feeling and a contemporary interpretation of the traditional ways of building in this area of Brazil," Mr Utrabo said.
