        The police rushed the pup to the hospital for treatment after stopping the "heartless" man, the tweet reads. Local media say it was the owner who was mistreating the dog. Authorities reportedly arrested him for abuse. The dog had several bruises and injuries to the stomach, according to the local press. Scans show there was no internal damage, however, and the dog has made a full recovery.
