            "Police said Chau had previously visited North Sentinel island about four or five times with the help of local fishermen," journalist Subir Bhaumik, who has been covering the islands for years, told BBC Hindi.Andaman Director of the General Police Dependra Pathak told the News Minute, an Indian news website, that Chau lived in the US state of Alabama and was "some kind of paramedic"."People thought he is a missionary because he had mentioned his position on God and that he was a believer on social media or somewhere online. But in a strict sense, he was not a missionary. "He was an adventurer. His intention was to meet the aborigines."

"Since then, the outdoors have been my home."
