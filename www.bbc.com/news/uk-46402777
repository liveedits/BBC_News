            Empty houses: MOD homes standing empty across UK
            More than 11,000 Ministry of Defence homes across the UK are empty, costing the taxpayer more than Â£25m a year in rent and maintenance. The MOD says it is doing its best to reduce the numbers but has to budget for thousands of service family house moves every year.
