Health ministry spokesman Wahid Majroh said clerics had been meeting at an Ulema Council gathering to mark the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad when the explosion took place.The Islamic State group said it was behind two attacks in Kabul in August that killed dozens of people.Dozens were also killed across the country as voters cast ballots in the nation's parliamentary elections in October.
