'Train emerged victor'General manager Andrew Munden said the Sweet Briar Lane crossing's lights and sirens were sounding at the time. "We are all so relieved that this was a low speed collision and that no-one was injured," he said. Services resumed by the afternoon after the Rail Accident Investigation Branch had given permission to clear the site, Mr Munden said.PC Jon Parker, of Norfolk Police tweeted: "Currently on scene at a train vs car incident.
