        Nissan and Mitsubishi shares have slumped in early Tokyo trade, after the arrest of chairman Carlos Ghosn.He is accused of under-reporting his income by 5bn yen ($44.4m; Â£34.5m) over five years, prosecutors said. He is also said to have used company assets for personal purposes. Mr Ghosn heads up the Japanese-French alliance Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi.Both Nissan and Mitsubishi have said they are preparing to remove him from his posts.Shares in Nissan were down about 4% by midday, Mitsubishi was also down more than 7%. Renault's shares lost more than than 8% in Europe. 
    
        
In a late night press conference on Monday, Nissan said an internal investigation prompted by a whistleblower had revealed "significant acts of misconduct".The announcement sent shockwaves through the automotive industry where Mr Ghosn, 64, is seen as influential global figure. Japanese prosecutors later said they had already raided Nissan's Yokohama headquarters, near Tokyo, as part of their investigation into Mr Ghosn. The executive's under-reporting of his salary may mean he has violated Japanese law around securities and company securities, a crime that carries punishments of up to 10 years in jail, or a 10m yen fine - or both, according to Japan's Kyodo news agency.Nissan boss arrested over 'misconduct'

Last year the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance said it sold 10.61 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, making it the number-one automotive group worldwide.In response to Mr Ghosn's arrest, Mitsubishi said it would "promptly remove Ghosn from his position as [Mitsubishi's] chairman of the board and representative director".The board of Renault is also expected to meet to decide Mr Ghosn's future.
