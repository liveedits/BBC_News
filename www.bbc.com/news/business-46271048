The corporate scandals that rocked Japan
What has happened so far?In a late night press conference on Monday, Nissan said an internal investigation prompted by a whistleblower had revealed "significant acts of misconduct".The announcement sent shockwaves through the automotive industry where Mr Ghosn, 64, is seen as titan, responsible for a dramatic turnaround at Nissan in the early 2000s.Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa said "too much authority was given to one person in terms of governance," speaking at the Yokohama headquarters of the firm."I have to say that this is a dark side of the Ghosn era which lasted for a long time," Mr Hiroto said adding he was still thinking through whether Mr Ghosn was "a charismatic figure or a tyrant".What are the accusations? Prosecutors later said in a statement that Mr Ghosn and Representative Director Greg Kelly conspired to understate Mr Ghosn's compensation starting in 2010.Mr Ghosn is accused of filing annual securities reports containing fake statements, which could mean up to 10 years in prison, or a fine of 10m yen, or both.From 2010, Japanese firms have been required to disclose the salaries of executives who earn more than 100m yen.Japanese prosecutors also said they had already raided Nissan's Yokohama headquarters, near Tokyo, as part of their investigation.No further details of his alleged misconduct were provided. But some specifics were being reported by Japanese media. Broadcaster NHK reported, citing unnamed sources, that Nissan provided Mr Ghosn with houses in four countries without legitimate business justifications. There has been no comment from Mr Ghosn or Mr Kelly.How will this impact the alliance? As misconduct revelations emerged, the future of the car alliance led by Mr Ghosn remained unclear.  He has been credited with turning around both Nissan and Renault before becoming the linchpin of the alliance the firm's later formed. The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance sold 10.61 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, making it the number-one automotive group worldwide.Nissan chief executive Mr Saikawa insisted the partnership "will not be affected by this event".
