        Ms Stefaniak, from the Miami area, and her sister-in-law April Burton were visiting Costa Rica to celebrate Ms Stefaniak's birthday, but Ms Burton returned to Florida a day before Ms Stefaniak. The women had stayed at an Airbnb rental in the San Jose suburb of Escazu. The last time Ms Burton saw Ms Stefaniak was when she dropped her off at the airport on 27 November.Ms Stefaniak then reportedly took an Uber from the airport to do some sightseeing around San Jose before she was dropped off at the Airbnb.

            But her family later learned she never boarded the flight home.The Airbnb rental owner and local security guards said they saw her get into an unknown car with her luggage at around 05:00 local time, according to the family."None of us really believe this 5am story because it really doesn't make sense," Ms Burton told Fox News. "There's no reason for her not to contact anyone."

            According to the family's Facebook page, Finding Carla, officials were not pursuing the matter because Ms Stefaniak had appeared "rational at the time of her disappearance and got into a taxi of her own free will".Airbnb has declined to comment on the matter.The US Embassy in Costa Rica did not immediately return a request for comment.
