The captain announced to passengers that he had decided to turn back after the "malfunction of several electronic systems". 
    
        
The plane's communications system went down and the crew had to use a satellite phone to contact air traffic controllers, Germany's Spiegel website reported. The problem is thought to have been with an electronic distribution box, which controls both the radio and discharge of aviation fuel.The German air force denied suggestions that the plane's electronics could have been sabotaged. "There's is absolutely no indication of a criminal background," a spokesman said. An added problem for the plane was that Cologne airport's longer runway was unavailable, Spiegel added. As the A340 had to slow down quickly and it was still fully laden with fuel, its braking system overheated and the fire brigade met the plane on the tarmac.The German delegation was kept on the plane for some time before officials decided to travel by bus to a hotel in Bonn.

            German media added that the chancellor, her husband and the finance minister were expected to travel to Madrid on an air force plane on Friday morning before taking a scheduled Iberia airlines flight on to Argentina.The Airbus A340-300 government aircraft is named Konrad Adenauer after West Germany's first post-war chancellor.For finance minister Olaf Scholz, the Konrad Adenauer's technical problems are nothing new.In October he was on a trip to Indonesia when the plane was grounded because rodents had gnawed through electrical cables during an annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), DPA reported.
