Orthodox Church split: Five reasons why it mattersDespite Russia banning priests from the branch of the Church loyal to Moscow from the event, two of its bishops were reportedly seen arriving for the council in Kiev.What happened in Kiev?The special council was held in the ancient St Sophia's Cathedral - one of Kiev's best known landmarks.Ukrainian clerics of different Orthodox denominations - including some bishops from the Moscow branch - elected Metropolitan Epifaniy as the leader of the new church. "This day will go into history as a sacred day... the day of the final independence from Russia," President Poroshenko told a crowd of thousands outside the cathedral.

            Ahead of the meeting, Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, called on religious and world leaders to protect believers and clergymen in Ukraine from what he called persecution.What is the dispute all about?The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has been under the Moscow Patriarchate for centuries.But tensions within the church mounted after Ukraine became independent in 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union.Today there are currently three Orthodox Church branches based in Kiev: The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Kiev Patriarchate) 
The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) 
The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church
The drive for Ukrainian Orthodox independence intensified in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and Russia-backed separatists seized a big swathe of territory in eastern Ukraine.The Moscow branch of the Ukrainian Church has denied being a tool of the Kremlin, and says it has tried to bring about peace in eastern Ukraine.

            Earlier this year, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople - seen as the first among equals in the world's Orthodoxy - overruled its decision dating back to 1686 to transfer its jurisdiction over Kievan Orthodox churches (known as the Kievan Metropolis) to Moscow.Now Moscow fears losing many of its 12,000 parishes in Ukraine.Constantinople holds sway over more than 300 million Orthodox Christians across the world. The Russian Orthodox Church is by far the biggest.
