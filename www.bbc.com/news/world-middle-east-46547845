            An Iranian political activist jailed for his messages on social media has died after spending 60 days on hunger strike, his family says.Vahid Sayadi Nasiri had been accused of insulting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other offences.He was released last March after serving two-and-a-half years in prison but detained again five months later.The activist demanded his transfer from a high-security unit of a prison in the city of Qom to a different location.Vahid Sayadi Nasiri was initially arrested in September 2015 and sentenced to eight years in prison for "insulting the supreme leader" and "propaganda against the state," according to the advocacy group Iran Human Rights Monitor.
