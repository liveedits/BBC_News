            US comedian and actor Kevin Hart says he has stepped down from hosting the 2019 Oscars following a controversy over homophobic tweets.He said he did not want to be a distraction and that he was "sorry he had hurt people".The choice of Hart for host was only announced on Tuesday.But tweets from a decade ago emerged of apparent anti-gay slurs, sparking calls for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to drop him.Kevin Hart had said hosting the Oscars was "a goal on my list for a long time".
    
        
But in a tweet late on Thursday he said he had chosen to step down "because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists".He said: "I sincerely apologise to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words of the past."
