                    Yoshitaka Sakurada said his lack of experience with computers should not pose a problem
                
            Japan's new cyber-security minister has dumbfounded his country by saying he has never used a computer.Yoshitaka Sakurada made the admission to a committee of lawmakers."Since I was 25 years old and independent I have instructed my staff and secretaries. I have never used a computer in my life," he said, according to a translation by the Kyodo news agency.The 68-year-old was appointed to his post last month.His duties include overseeing cyber-defence preparations for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.

A politician from the opposition Democratic Party, Masato Imai, whose question had prompted the admission, expressed surprise."I find it unbelievable that someone who is responsible for cyber-security measures has never used a computer," he said.But Mr Sakurada responded that other officials had the necessary experience and he was confident there would not be a problem.However, his struggle to answer a follow-up question about whether USB drives were in use at the country's nuclear power stations caused further concern.The disclosure has been much discussed on social media where the reaction has been a mix of astonishment and hilarity, with some noting that at least it should mean Mr Sakurada would be hard to hack.
