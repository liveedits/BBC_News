        Media captionPresident Macron says he is 'partly responsible' for the 'insufficient response' to the yellow vest protestsA woman at the forefront of the "yellow-vest" protest movement in France has called for a "truce" in response to a series of concessions from President Emmanuel Macron.Jacline Mouraud said protesters couldn't "spend the rest of our lives on roundabouts".Other leaders have rejected his plans.Having already scrapped a fuel tax rise, Mr Macron promised an extra €100 (£90; $114) a month for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners.France has seen four weekends of violent protests from demonstrators known as gilets jaunes - or "yellow vests" - over fuel tax rises, living costs and other issues.
    
        
French press weigh Macron's 'risky gamble'An opinion poll carried out in the wake of Mr Macron's speech suggested 59% of French people surveyed were unimpressed by his measures, while 40% were.The total cost of the president's concessions would cost between €8bn and €10bn, officials said, putting France on course for breaching the EU's 3% limit on its 2019 budget deficit.The president of the National Assembly, Richard Ferrand, said the increase in the deficit would be "strictly temporary" and would not be "massive". The Macron government had planned a 2.8% deficit, but Mr Ferrand insisted France would "rediscover a rhythm" below 3% from the following year.What has been promised?The biggest promise was on the minimum wage, or "Smic", and affects 2.6 million people, according to the government.Initially described as a monthly increase in the Smic, it became clear that the government instead intended to speed up a planned increase in a supplement for minimum wage earners known as an "activity premium". That way, employers would not be taxed on the income.Other key concessions included:Cancelling a planned tax increase for pensioners on less than €2,000 a month
Scrapping tax on overtime pay
Removing tax from end-of-year bonuses for 2.3 million employees next week
However, President Macron refused to reinstate a tax on the wealthy, saying "this would weaken us, we need to create jobs". Other reforms to pensions, unemployment benefit and public spending would go ahead as planned, he said.

            Maxime Nicolle, whose videos have been shared by protesters, said it was "too little, too late".Another key voice, Benjamin Cauchy, complained of the president's "half measures". "€100 is all very well for minimum-wage types but what's in it for all the middle-earners struggling under enormous financial pressure?"Employers' organisation Medef praised the measures, because they were focused on people's purchasing power but did not target businesses themselves.One of the president's key allies, Modem party leader Francois Bayrou, praised Mr Macron's proposals as a change of era, not merely for his presidency but in the context of the past 30 years. "You can't have economic progress without social justice, if every citizen doesn't feel involved," he said.How did protests start?The protesters began as a grassroots French provincial movement with people donning high-visibility yellow jackets, which by law must be carried by every vehicle in France.Who are the 'gilets jaunes'?
