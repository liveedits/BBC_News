            A Siberian policeman described as Russia's most prolific mass murderer in modern times has been given a second life sentence.Mikhail Popkov, 53, murdered 55 women and a policeman near Irkutsk. He was already in jail for 22 other murders. He hacked women to death after offering them rides in his car late at night. At least 10 were also raped. In three cases he was on duty in his police car.Popkov was caught in 2012 after a DNA match identified his car. The victims were all women between the ages of 16 and 40 apart from one male, a policeman. The killings took place between 1992 and 2007.
    
        
Why were there so many serial killers in the 1980s?
Living in the shadow of an unsolved murder
Popkov killed them around the city of Angarsk, near Irkutsk, with an axe and hammer. He dumped their mutilated bodies in forests, by the roadside and in a local cemetery.The death toll exceeds the 48 murdered by "chessboard killer" Alexander Pichushkin, and the 52 murdered by Andrei Chikatilo during the Soviet era.Popkov claimed to be "purging" Angarsk of immoral women, but that was not true, as he had lured all sorts of women into his car.
