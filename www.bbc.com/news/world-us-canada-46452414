"You'll see a lot of joy," Ron Kaufman, who worked as Mr Bush's political director, said of the funeral."It'll show the way of life that people took for granted in many ways and now kind of long for," he told Reuters.Wednesday has been declared a national day of mourning - many government offices and US stock exchanges are closed.After the funeral, Mr Bush's body will be flown to Texas, where it will lie in public repose until Thursday morning. There will be a second service before the Bush 4141 - a train which was named in honour of the president - takes his body to its final resting place at the George HW Bush presidential library. Jim McGrath, who was Mr Bush's spokesman, said the president had once wondered if anyone would attend his funeral.

        Who was Bush Sr and what is his legacy?George HW Bush was a decorated fighter pilot in World War Two, a head of the CIA and vice-president to Ronald Reagan before being elected president in 1988.His time in office was dominated by foreign policy - and he was praised for how he navigated the end of the Cold War, and handled the first Gulf War. However, he was accused of neglecting domestic affairs and, after reneging on a campaign promise not to increase taxes, lost to Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election.He has been described as a bipartisan figure who tried to make conservatism "kinder and gentler".Mr Trump has in the past clashed with the Bush family - and Mr Bush told a historian he voted for Mr Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.Mr Bush's former White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, told Reuters: "It's important for our presidents to pay respect to each other and I'm glad President Trump will be there."

                The 41st President will be carried to his final rest wearing socks that pay tribute to his lifetime of service, starting as an 18 year-old naval aviator in war. That legacy is now being carried, in part, by the brave, selfless men and women aboard @CVN77_GHWB. #Remembering41 pic.twitter.com/OabtK756fOâ€” Jim McGrath (@jgm41) December 3, 2018
