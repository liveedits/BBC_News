In his eulogy, George W Bush said his father had taught him that "public service is noble and necessary"."He accepted failure is part of living a full life, but taught us never to be defined by failure. He showed us how setbacks can strengthen," he added.His voice breaking with emotion at the end of his eulogy, Mr Bush said: "Through our tears, let us know the blessings of knowing and loving you.

        There will be a second service before the Bush 4141 - a train which was named in honour of the president - takes his body to its final resting place, next to his wife Barbara at the George HW Bush presidential library. Jim McGrath, who was Mr Bush's spokesman, said the president had once wondered if anyone would attend his funeral.What other tributes were paid?Presidential historian Jon Meacham described Mr Bush Sr as "America's last great soldier statesman", recounting how he had served as a US Navy pilot in World War Two and survived after his plane was shot down over the Pacific."His life was a perennial effort to prove himself worthy of his salvation on that distant morning," he said.What is Bush Senior's legacy?
The making of a president
Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney praised Mr Bush Sr's role in navigating the end of the Cold War."When George Bush was president of the United States of America, every single head of government in the world knew that they were dealing with a gentleman, a genuine leader, one who was distinguished, resolute and brave," he said.Former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson said Mr Bush had a simple credo: "What would we do without family and friends?"Who was Bush Sr and what is his legacy?George HW Bush was a decorated fighter pilot in World War Two, a head of the CIA and vice-president to Ronald Reagan before being elected president in 1988.His time in office was dominated by foreign policy - and he was praised for how he navigated the end of the Cold War, and handled the first Gulf War.
