Among the victims were also elderly residents with mobility issues or people who decided to stay despite evacuation orders. Forensic experts are stepping up their search in the ruins of Paradise, but officials warn that finding the bodies could take weeks. Two mobile army morgues are being brought in to help to identify the dead.

Why are the fires so bad?Historically, California's "wildfire season" started in summer and ran into early autumn. But experts have warned that the risk is now year-round. The current fires are being blamed on a combination of climate change and weather conditions.Low humidity, warm Santa Ana winds, and dry ground after a rain-free month have produced a prime fire-spreading environment.The experts who start fires to study them
Why can't California control its wildfires?
The state's 40-million-strong population also helps explain the fires' deadliness. That number is almost double what it was in the 1970s, and people are living closer to at-risk forest areas.

            And then there's climate change. Recent years have produced record-breaking temperatures, earlier springs, and less reliable rainfall.Citing the role of a warming climate, Governor Brown declared: "This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal."Musician Neil Young made the same link, writing on his website: "I have lost my home before to a California wildfire, now another." "We are vulnerable because of climate change; the extreme weather events and our extended drought is part of it."Have you been affected by the wildfires? If it is safe to do so please get in touch.
