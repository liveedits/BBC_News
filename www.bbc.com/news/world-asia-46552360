                    Designers 5149 have been criticised for their use of North Korean imagery to promote their product
                
            In an interview with the New York Times, 5149 chief executive Kwak Hyeon-ju said she wanted the masks to celebrate the "once in a lifetime" Korean summits held earlier this year.Dozens of Koreans have posted pictures of themselves on social media with the masks, which cost 4,000 won (£2.80).But several stores have pulled them from their shelves following a backlash from local media."Personally, I don't like merchandise promoting a certain political agenda," Irene Kim, a South Korean skincare expert, told the South China Morning Post. "A few years ago, North Korea was the largest threat to our country… Kim Jong-un was seen as a dictator and a tyrant who would stop at nothing to disrupt world peace, now he's become the face of a popular face mask," she added.Mr Kim has led North Korea since the death of its former dictator, his father Kim Jong-il, in 2011. The country's communist regime has been criticised by the UN and human rights groups for "systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations".
