        Theresa May will face a fight for her leadership after at least 48 members of her own party put in writing that they have lost confidence in her. Any time the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives - Sir Graham Brady - receives letters from 15% of the party's MPs, a secret ballot is triggered. If Mrs May wins, they cannot challenge her premiership for another year.But, if she loses, there will be a leadership election and she will not be allowed to run.
