Ms Meng is accused in the US of using a Huawei subsidiary called Skycom to evade sanctions on Iran between 2009 and 2014.US prosecutors say she had publicly misrepresented Skycom as being a separate company and deceived banks about the true relationship between the two companies.Ms Meng has denied any wrongdoing and said she will contest the allegations.
