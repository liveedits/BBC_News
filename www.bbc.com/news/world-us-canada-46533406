        The chief financial officer of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has been granted bail by a Canadian court.Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder, could be extradited to the US to face fraud charges linked to the alleged violation of sanctions on Iran.A judge in Vancouver set bail at C$10m (Â£6m; $7.4m). She will be under surveillance 24 hours a day and must wear an electronic ankle tag.Ms Meng, 46, was arrested in Vancouver on 1 December. Her detention has angered China and threatened to worsen its trade war with the US.
    
        
At the three-day hearing in Vancouver, her lawyers sought to provide guarantees that she would not pose a flight risk if granted bail. The application was opposed by Canadian prosecutors.Ms Meng is accused in the US of using a Huawei subsidiary called Skycom to evade sanctions on Iran between 2009 and 2014.US prosecutors say she had publicly misrepresented Skycom as being a separate company and deceived banks about the true relationship between the two companies.Ms Meng has denied wrongdoing and said she will contest the allegations.
