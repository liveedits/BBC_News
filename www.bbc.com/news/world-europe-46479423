            The AFP news agency reports that authorities seized 28 Molotov cocktails and 3 homemade bombs from "yellow vest" protesters in the south of the country. There has also been widespread anger at images showing how police made high school students kneel and put their hands behind their heads following clashes on Thursday in Mantes-la-Jolie, to the west of Paris. What has the government said?Mr Castaner told reporters that the past three weeks of demonstrations had "created a monster that escaped from its creators."He said authorities would respond with "firmness". He went on: "I will have no tolerance of those who capitalise on the distress of our citizens."Who are the 'gilets jaunes'?
Ball in Macron's court after violent protests
An official with the interior ministry told AFP news agency authorities were braced for "significant violence" on Saturday, with activists from both the far right and far left planning to converge on the capital.In an interview with TV channel TF1, Mr Philippe said 8,000 police would be deployed in Paris as well as a dozen armoured vehicles. He repeated an appeal for calm but added: "We are facing people who are not here to protest, but to smash and we want to have the means not to give them a free rein."Earlier, Mr Philippe suggested there might be further concessions to protesters, telling the Senate that the government was open to new measures to help the lowest-paid workers.How will Paris be affected?The operator of the Eiffel Tower said the threat of violent protests on Saturday made it impossible to ensure "adequate security conditions".City authorities say they are stepping up protection for famous landmarks after the Arc de Triomphe was damaged last week.

"Now there's a well-behaved class," a police office was heard saying on video. The town's police chief told Le Monde newspaper that those arrested were suspected of taking part in an "armed gathering", adding that officers had wanted to break up a situation that was getting "out of control." Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said he was "clearly shocked", by the events but added that they must be put in "context". Mr Castaner described the images as "tough" to watch but added that the students had been joined by armed protesters. Dozens of schools were blockaded in cities including Marseille, Nantes and Paris. Students have been angered by President Emmanuel Macron's plans to change the end-of-school exam, known as the baccalaureate, which is required for entrance to university. Critics fear the reforms will limit opportunity and breed inequality.Who are the protesters?The "gilets jaunes" protesters, so-called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law, initially complained at a sharp increase in diesel taxes.Mr Macron said his motivation for the increase was environmental, but protesters accused him of being out of touch. The government later scrapped the plan but the yellow vest protesters were not placated. Last week, the movement - despite a lack of central leadership - issued more than 40 demands to government.Among them were a minimum pension, widespread changes to the tax system, and a reduction in the retirement age.The protest movement has gained momentum via social media, encompassing a whole range of participants from the anarchist far left to the nationalist far right, and moderates in between.
