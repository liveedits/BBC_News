            The gunman exchanged fire with officers who were patrolling the area as part of anti-terror measures.It is thought he was injured. According to Mr Castaner, the man "fought twice with our security forces".How did he escape?According to France's BFM TV, he managed to reach a taxi which drove him away from the scene and dropped him in the vicinity of the police station in Neudorf, the area where he is understood to live.It was the taxi driver who told police the man was wounded in his left leg.Residents in Neudorf have been urged to stay indoors.What do we know about the gunman?A picture is beginning to emerge of the suspected attacker, although a motive is still not known.He has not been officially named, but French media are referring to him as Cherif C.According to police, he was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services as a possible terrorist threat: he was the subject of a "fiche S", the same system under which Amedy Coulibaly  - who attacked a supermarket in 2015 - was flagged.

            He is understood to have served prison sentences in both France and Germany.BFM TV described him as a "repeat offender" and "delinquent", adding he was part of known extremist networks in the city.Stephane Morisse, from the FGP police union, said the man's flat in the Neudorf district of the city had been searched by police in connection with a robbery on Tuesday morning, but he was not there.Grenades were found during the search, according to BFM TV.What about the victims?Nothing is known of the victims yet.However, eyewitness Pater Fritz told the BBC he heard gunfire and found a person who had been shot, lying on a bridge. He said he tried to resuscitate him but the man died.He said no ambulance services had been able to enter the area, adding: "After 45 minutes we stopped the resuscitation [attempt], because a doctor told us on the phone that it was senseless."Another eyewitness, who gave his name as Fatih, told AFP news agency that after the shots were fired there was "pandemonium" on the streets. "People were running everywhere," he said.Local journalist Bruno Poussard wrote on Twitter that there had been a dozen shots fired on his street in the city centre - one or two to begin with, then in bursts.
