Strasbourg shooting: What we know so far
Face to face with the gunman
Police say anyone who sees the "dangerous" suspect should not approach him, but instead call an emergency hotline. The lights of Paris' Eiffel Tower were turned off overnight in tribute to the victims of the attack. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said the gesture was to show the city's support to the families affected and "all of Strasbourg".

            He has 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and has spent considerable time in prison as a result.Police were seeking him on Tuesday morning in connection with another case, but did not find him at home.A search of his apartment in Neudorf revealed a grenade, a rifle, four knives - two of which were hunting knives - and ammunition.'Weary and deflated'By Damian Grammaticas, StrasbourgStrasbourg's famous Christmas market is now a gloomy place. The lines of wooden huts are all shuttered. The owner of one told us how he had to flee when he heard the gunshots and take shelter in a local bar. "We're all shaken up," he said. At this time of year, the place should be thronged with people who come from far and wide to sightsee and shop, buying everything from hot sausages to souvenirs. Now there's a weary, deflated feeling. Police stand guard at cordoned off alleyways. "Everyone was shouting, everyone was running, running, afraid," said one eyewitness who'd seen the gunman shooting randomly. Strasbourg has been a target for failed terror attacks before. But now it's happened, people here are hurt and outraged. As one said: "It's shameful."Who are the victims?Anupong Suebsamarn, 45, a tourist from Thailand, has been named by Thai media as one of the dead. He is believed to have been on holiday with his wife.The Italian foreign ministry has said one of the injured is an Italian journalist who was covering the European parliament, but declined to confirm media reports  that he was in a serious condition.One soldier was slightly injured by a ricocheting bullet during an exchange of fire with the gunman.Why is Strasbourg a target?Strasbourg has been the target of jihadist plots in the past.Not only does it have one of France's oldest Christmas markets, but it is the official seat of the European Parliament. That parliament was in session at the time of Tuesday evening's attack.In 2000, the Christmas market was at the centre of a failed al-Qaeda plot. Ten Islamist militants were jailed four years later for their part in the planned New Year's Eve attack.However, MEPs were determined to carry on the morning after the attack, with German MEP Jo Leinen posting a picture of singing and Christmas lights in the European Parliament.
