Other British talents in the running include Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw, nominated for their roles in BBC political drama A Very English Scandal.There are also TV nominations for Benedict Cumberbatch (for Patrick Melrose), Westworld's Thandie Newton and Sacha Baron Cohen, in contention for his satirical series Who is America?.
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        AnalysisBy entertainment correspondent, Lizo MzimbaIt's important to note that the 95 or so journalists of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association who vote for the Golden Globes are a very different body of people to the 8,200 film professionals of the Academy who vote in the Oscars.There's actually only one person who votes in both - actress turned journalist Lisa Lu, who plays the family matriarch in Crazy Rich Asians.So a good showing in the Golden Globes doesn't necessarily mean that Oscar glory is sure to follow. But it's wrong to say the Globes don't exert some influence.Right now DVDs and Blu-rays of awards contenders are piling up in the homes and offices of members of the Academy. Films that have been shut out today - like Mary, Queen of Scots and the Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic On the Basis of Sex - may well sink down the priorities pile of some voters. The good showing of movies like Vice, meanwhile, will no doubt see it rise closer to the top.The timing of the awards ceremony in January is crucial. The morning after the Globes are handed out, a week of Academy Awards voting begins. So a win at the Golden Globes might be the final decider for voters deciding which films to put on their Oscar nominations ballot.
