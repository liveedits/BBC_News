        How did Tuesday's attack unfold?At about 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT), a man opened fire close to the famed Christmas market near place Kléber, which attracts thousands of visitors.France's anti-terror prosecutor, Rémy Heitz, said the man had shouted "Allahu Akbar" ("God is greatest") as he opened fire.The suspect was armed with a gun and a knife and escaped the area after jumping into a taxi, Mr Heitz said.
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        As he fled he came into contact with four soldiers, Mr Heitz said, and began firing at them. The soldiers fired back, apparently hitting him in the arm.The attacker told the taxi driver he had killed 10 people, and also said he had been injured during a firefight with soldiers.He ordered the taxi driver to drop him near the police station in Neudorf. When he got out of the vehicle, he fired at police officers before escaping.What do we know about the suspect?Chekatt was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services.He was the subject of a "fiche S", a watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security.He had 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and had spent considerable time in prison as a result.Police were seeking him on Tuesday morning in connection with another case, but did not find him at home.Strasbourg shooting: Face to face with gunmanA search of his apartment in Neudorf revealed a grenade, a rifle, four knives - two of which were hunting knives - and ammunition.The Islamic State group's self-styled news agency, Amaq, on Thursday said that Chekatt was "an Islamic State soldier" who had "carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting citizens of coalition countries" fighting its militants in Syria and Iraq.Who were the victims of the attack?Three people died in Tuesday's attack, according to a new toll from the local préfecture on Thursday.One of the five seriously injured in this attack has been declared brain-dead, said the Paris prosecutor's office on Thursday.The death of Kamal Naghchband, a garage mechanic originally from Afghanistan, was announced on Thursday.
