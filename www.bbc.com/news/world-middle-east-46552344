            Two Israelis have been shot dead by a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank, the Israeli military says, amid an upsurge of attacks in the area.One person was also severely injured when the gunman fired at a bus stop. A hunt for the suspect is under way. It took place near the Ofra settlement, Israeli media say, where a separate shooting on Sunday by a Palestinian led to the death of an Israeli baby.Dozens of Israelis have been killed in such attacks in the past three years.Israel said earlier on Thursday that it had found two suspected Palestinian attackers - one who they said carried out Sunday's shooting, and the other suspected of killing two Israelis in an attack on a factory in a West Bank settlement in October.
