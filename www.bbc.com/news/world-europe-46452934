Meanwhile, in Belgium, broadcaster VRT reported that police were focused on the province of Limburg.The operation comes a day after Italian police arrested the supposed new "godfather" of the Sicilian Mafia, Settimo Mineo, in a dawn raid.The 80-year-old jeweller is believed to have been chosen as the successor to Toto Riina, who died in jail a year ago.
