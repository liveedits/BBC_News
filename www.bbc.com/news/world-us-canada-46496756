The people around Donald Trump
Mr Kelly's expected departure means Mr Trump will have had three chiefs of staff and three national security advisers since taking office in January 2017, the BBC's North America Correspondent Anthony Zurcher says.Last month Reuters news agency quoted a source as saying that Vice-President Mike Pence's chief of staff Nick Ayers was a possible contender for the role.Earlier this year Mr Kelly was forced to deny that he had called Mr Trump an "idiot" after the quote was included in a book about Mr Trump by the veteran investigative journalist Bob Woodward.Mr Kelly is said to have used the description repeatedly and also allegedly said that "it's pointless to try to convince him of anything".Woodward on Trump - the explosive quotes
