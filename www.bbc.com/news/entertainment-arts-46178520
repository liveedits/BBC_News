        The musician confirmed the loss of his house in a statement posted on his website.He also discussed climate change and criticised President Donald Trump. Young's post referenced the president's controversial tweet that blamed California's "gross mismanagement" for the damage caused by the wildfires."Imagine a leader who defies science, saying these solutions shouldn't be part of his decision-making on our behalf," Young wrote. This is the second time the rock star has lost his home to a wildfire, according to Vulture. The 1978 Malibu firestorm destroyed hundreds of homes, including Young's.
