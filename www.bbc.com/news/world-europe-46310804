It is another very indicative sign of permanent pathogens in the criminal justice system," the Hellenic League for Human Rights said in a statement.
    
        
A senior prosecutor for the Supreme Court is to look at the regional court's legal reasoning next week, judicial sources told Reuters.The discrepancy in the unnamed woman's educational record was discovered during a review in 2014.In the past it was not unusual for Greek schoolchildren to be forced out of education by poverty, especially in rural areas.
