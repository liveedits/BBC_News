            With thousands expected to join rallies against sexist violence around the world, in the middle of a major summit on Brexit there was a gesture of solidarity from a top EU official.As he spoke on stage, European Parliament president Antonio Tajani smeared red make-up under his eye, an act intended to symbolise the domestic violence suffered by many women."Violence against women is unacceptable. I learned this from my mother and I'm teaching it to my children," he later tweeted. Mr Tajani was showing his support the UN's International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. Marked each year on 25 November, the day is the start of 16-day campaign, calling on people and organisations to address violence. 
    
        
According to the UN, it will affect more than a third of women globally during their lives.The bulk of the support was on the streets, with rallies on Saturday and more to come on Sunday. Here are some of the best pictures.

                    The high turnout was an answer to a citizen collective's call for a "feminist tidal wave" of outrage against gender violence, organiser Caroline de Haas said
