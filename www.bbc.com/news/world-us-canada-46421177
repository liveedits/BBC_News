        Officials said, in the days that followed, that the alarmingly high list of the missing was "dynamic" as they dealt with a large number of calls, reports and emails from people worried about those they could not get hold of.Some media organisations at the time pointed out irregularities in the county's list. One Paradise resident who escaped the fire and was recovering in Virginia did not know she was on the list of missing until last week.
