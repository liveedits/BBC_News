            Robots that build 'baby robots'
            Researchers at Cambridge University have developed a robot that can build "baby" robots that get progressively better at moving - without any human intervention. The ultimate aim is to develop robots that can evolve and adapt to their surroundings.The development is part of an initiative to develop robots that are more versatile by copying animals. Our science correspondent Pallab Ghosh has been to the robot lab to take a look for himself.He spoke to Dr Fumiya Iida, the mechatronic engineer who led the project.
