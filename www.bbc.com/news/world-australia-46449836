            Australian police have arrested the husband of a Sydney woman whose disappearance in 1982 has been the subject of a popular crime podcast.Chris Dawson, 70, is to be charged with murdering Lynette Dawson, New South Wales (NSW) authorities said.Mr Dawson has denied killing Mrs Dawson. He has said that she abandoned the family for a religious group.A popular podcast, The Teacher's Pet, brought global attention to the case this year.Police arrested Mr Dawson in Queensland and said he would be extradited to NSW. 
    
        
Prosecutors have previously said there was insufficient evidence to lay charges against Mr Dawson.Two separate inquests have recommended for murder charges to be laid against a "known person".No trace of the mother of two has ever been found.

The pair later married, but have since separated.Since May, more than 27 million people have listened The Teacher's Pet podcast, which is produced by The Australian newspaper.Why 2018 is the year of the 'podcast boom'
