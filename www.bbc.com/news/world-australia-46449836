                    Lynette Dawson's disappearance has been given wider attention by a popular podcast
                
            Australian police have arrested the husband of a Sydney woman whose disappearance in 1982 has been the subject of a popular crime podcast.Chris Dawson, 70, is to be charged with murdering Lynette Dawson, New South Wales (NSW) authorities said.Mr Dawson has denied killing Mrs Dawson, with whom he has two children. He has said that she abandoned the family for a religious group.A podcast, The Teacher's Pet, brought global attention to the case this year.Police arrested Mr Dawson in Queensland and said he would be extradited to NSW. 
    
        
Two separate inquests have recommended for murder charges to be laid against a "known person".However, prosecutors have previously said there was insufficient evidence to lay charges. No trace of Mrs Dawson has ever been found.Police 'confident'A search of the family's former home in Sydney earlier this year failed to turn up new evidence.But police on Wednesday said the arrest followed three years of renewed investigations."We are confident with the case," Supt Scott Cook told reporters.

            "We won't give up on trying to identify the whereabouts of Lynette Dawson, but, from our perspective, it is not crucial to finalising the matter."An inquest in 2003 found that Mr Dawson, a former high school teacher and rugby league star, had engaged in sexual relationships with teenage students during his marriage.One 16-year-old girl moved in to the family home within days of Mrs Dawson's disappearance. The pair later married, but have since separated.Why 2018 is the year of the 'podcast boom'
Are podcasts breaking through to the mainstream?
Since May, more than 27 million people have listened The Teacher's Pet podcast, which is produced by The Australian newspaper.It has highlighted the bungled handling of Mrs Dawson's case by police in the early years after her disappearance, prompting a recent apology from the state's police commissioner.
