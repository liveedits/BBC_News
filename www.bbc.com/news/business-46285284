        The Trump administration has accused China of not changing its "unfair" practices, inflaming a trade dispute between the world's two largest economies. In an update to a March report, the US said China had failed to alter its "unreasonable" practices. The US has, along with other countries, long criticised Beijing over its trade policies. The move raises tensions ahead of a high-stakes leaders meeting this month.

The findings are part of an investigation into Beijing's intellectual property and technology transfer practices, which has prompted tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods. Mr Lighthizer said the updated report was part of the Trump administration's "strengthened monitoring and enforcement effort".

 China vs the US: Not just a trade war
What is a trade war?
So far, the US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese goods, totalling more than $250bn (Â£195.5bn). Beijing has struck back.

A top Chinese diplomat said the failure of Apec officials to agree on a communique was a result of certain countries "excusing" protectionism, a veiled threat at Washington, Reuters reports. At the meeting, US Vice-President Mike Pence said he was prepared to "more than double" the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods.
