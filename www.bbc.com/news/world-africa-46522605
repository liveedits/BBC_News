            Egypt has restricted the sale of yellow vests ahead of the anniversary of the 2011 uprising, to stop demonstrators copying French protesters.Safety equipment dealers can only sell the vests wholesale to verified companies that have gained police approval, retailers said. Officials have asked shopkeepers to report anyone trying to buy the clothing.French protesters donned the vests in anti-government demonstrations.Originally objecting to a proposed fuel tax rise, protesters soon reflected a wider discontent about President Emmanuel Macron's economic policies.

Why the 'yellow vests' won't stop protests
Protesters outside France, including in Belgium and the Netherlands, have also adopted the clothing, while British news site The Independent reports a "red vest" movement has been launched in Tunisia.

            Egyptian state media has stressed the violence of the French movement to scare any potential copycat demonstrators.

Paying the price for seeking freedom in Egypt
One man, Mohamed Ramadan, has been detained for 15 days and accused with disrupting public order and possessing yellow vests after making light of the restrictions in a Facebook post, his lawyer said.Meanwhile, some shopkeepers were made to sign a paper promising not to sell the clothing.The sale restrictions will be in force until the end of January.
