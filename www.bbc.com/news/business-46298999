        Nissan's board has voted to dismiss Carlos Ghosn as chairman following his arrest over allegations of financial misconduct, Japanese media has said.He has been accused by Nissan of under-reporting his salary and using company assets for personal use. But some see it as part of the firm's attempt to rebalance power in its alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi, which Mr Ghosn also chairs. The 64-year-old was the architect of the tie-up between the three firms.The board also voted to remove senior executive Greg Kelly, the Nikkei newspaper reported.
    
        
The two men remain in custody in Tokyo. Mitsubishi Motors will meet to discuss Mr Ghosn's role there next week. Two days ago Renault's board said it was appointing a temporary deputy chief executive to take over the running of the French car firm.  Is Carlos Ghosn's arrest a ‘hatchet job’?
