            Three men have been held in connection with the killing of a police officer in mob violence over alleged cow slaughter in India's Uttar Pradesh state.Subodh Kumar Singh died when right-wing Hindu groups clashed with police over their alleged inability to stop cow slaughter.Police are looking for 24 others suspected to be involved in Monday's murder in Bulandshahr district.Cows are considered holy by India's majority Hindu population.Many states have actively started enforcing bans on cow slaughter after the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) formed India's federal government in 2014.
    
        
So-called cow vigilantism has been on the rise and led to several killings in the past few years.In Monday's incident, a mob attacked policemen and set fire to a police station in Bulandshahr alleging cow slaughter in the area. An 18-year-old protester was killed and another policeman was injured in the violence.A night patrol with India's cow protection vigilantes

The police have registered cases of rioting, attempt to murder and destruction of property against 50 unnamed people.Shops and schools in the area are shut and more than 1,000 policemen have been deployed, says BBC Hindi's Nitin Srivastava in Bulandshahr. Our correspondent says incidents of violence over alleged cow slaughter are not uncommon in this region, but a direct attack on the police is unprecedented.The incident has prompted outrage on social media, with many calling the attack "senseless" and "barbaric".
