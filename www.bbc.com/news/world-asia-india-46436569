Cows are considered holy by India's majority Hindu population. Many states have actively started enforcing bans on cow slaughter after the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) formed India's federal government in 2014. So-called cow vigilantism has been on the rise and has led to several killings in the past few years.
