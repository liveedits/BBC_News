        A prominent Syrian media activist has been shot dead by gunmen in the rebel-held province of Idlib, Syria. Raed Fares, a well-known Syrian media activist, was killed in the northwestern town of Kafranbel. Mr Fares founded Radio Fresh, an independent radio station broadcasting from inside opposition-held areas in the country. He and his radio station had been targeted by jihadist groups in the past. A sarcastic response to Syria's militants
Why does the battle for Idlib matter?
Sense of an ending for Syria's war on Idlib front line
Four years ago, when the Islamic State (IS) group had a presence in Idlib province, the station's office was raided by militants.  In 2016, Mr Fares was detained by the Nusra Front, the former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria.

                A new tragedy is added to our long tragic record, tens of times I’ve asked him to leave after he was targeted for the first time and then a second time, and now the third brutal terroristic targeting he has been killed. He was stubborn and dismissive, he would simply answer; pic.twitter.com/edymFcBIkC— Fadel Abdul Ghany (@FADELABDULGHANY) November 23, 2018

The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham alliance (HTS), which currently controls most of Idlib province, ordered Radio Fresh to stop broadcasting music. The station's response was to play "sarcastic" sounds such as animal noises. Radio Fresh's Facebook page posted a graphic photo of Mr Fares's body on 23 November, along with an image of the body of Hammoud Juneid, another activist who was shot dead.

                Don't want to believe @RaedFares4 has been killed. One of the few peaceful pro-democracy activists from the early days of the uprising who was still in #Syria .Tireless, uncompromisingly principled, good humored, big-hearted and much more. A huge loss. #KafraNbel . RIP my friend pic.twitter.com/XjWMhnfu3S— Donatella Rovera (@DRovera) November 23, 2018
