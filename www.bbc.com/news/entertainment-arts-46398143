        Writer and campaigner Paris Lees is the first trans person to become a regular columnist in Vogue's 125-year history.The Life-Changing Power Of... column will run fortnightly in British Vogue and focus on her millennial life as a woman living in London.Lees thanked editor Edward Enninful for "the fresh life he's breathing into this iconic brand".Earlier this year, she also became the first openly trans person to be featured in British Vogue.She appeared in the magazine's February issue in a spread called Meet the New Suffragettes, to mark 100 years since women won the right to vote. 
    
        
At the time, she said she felt like the trans community had been under "constant attack in Britain over the past few years" and growing up, she rarely saw trans people in public life unless they were "objects of ridicule"."Thank God that's changing," she added.
