            An electoral commission official said some electronic voting machines had been destroyed in the blaze, but did not say how many.The BBC's Louise Dewast in Kinshasa says several opposition candidates have called for these machines to be banned, as they believe they could be used to rig the vote.Mr Kabila is backing his former Interior Minister, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, in the election.The vote is expected to be a tight contest between him, opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi and business tycoon Martin Fayulu.DR Congo has not had a peaceful, democratic transfer of power since independence from Belgium in 1960.
