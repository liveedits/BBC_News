Investigators said they believed Ms Cruz was killed by a gang in a case of mistaken identity. Murder rates in Mexico reached a record high in 2017 with official figures suggesting that more than 25,000 people were killed that year.

            He said that the suspect appeared to have been killed by members of his own gang for murdering the wrong person and thereby triggering a police hunt for the gang members. He said that there was little doubt the dead man was the shooter as his shoes matched the prints found at the gym and the gun he was carrying was that used to shoot Ms Cruz. Among the five people arrested are the man suspected of having ordered the murder and four of his alleged accomplices. It is not clear who their intended target was. Mexico has been wracked by gang violence for years and the government has deployed federal police and the army in various hotspots in an attempt to crack down on the gangs.But following the arrest of a number of key leaders, the murder rate has risen as rival cartels fight to fill the vacuum left behind.
