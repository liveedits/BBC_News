                    The prime minister is to defend her deal at the G20 summit in Argentina
                
            Theresa May has urged MPs to think about their constituents, rather than rejecting her deal for leaving the EU.The PM, who was on her way to the G20 summit in Argentina, said her plan would protect the "jobs and livelihoods and security" of their constituents.And she accused Labour of advocating leaving without a deal by rejecting her Brexit compromise while not putting forward a "proper alternative".Labour argues a better agreement could still be negotiated with Brussels.There is continued wrangling over the withdrawal deal negotiated with the European Union, which is widely expected to be rejected by MPs when it is put to a Commons vote on 11 December.

Let's focus on the deal that we have negotiated with the EU, a deal which is good for the UK and good for their constituents," she said.

The Falkland Islands - still claimed by Argentina, 36 years after the 1982 war with Britain - is likely to be discussed at a meeting Mrs May has with the country's president, Mauricio Macri, during the gathering, although the main focus of their talks will trade.Mrs May said: "I am clear that our position on the sovereignty of the Falklands has not changed. What has changed in recent months is we have seen better relations with Argentina."'Raise our sights'In the UK, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is to defend Mrs May's deal, saying that while it will not please everyone, critics "are yet to face up to" the "tough choices" she had to make.

            In a speech at the Portbury Royal Docks, near Bristol, Mr Fox, who campaigned for Brexit, will also play down reports suggesting that UK economic growth after Brexit would be slower than if the UK stayed in the EU."The deal we've reached will give us a firm and stable base on which to leave the EU and build this country's global future, a future that still encompasses Europe, of course, but also the wide fast-growing markets beyond, with all the opportunity that entails."
