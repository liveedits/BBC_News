His Fox interview was recorded before news of the CIA's findings emerged and he said his administration's verdict was imminent."We'll be having a very full report over the next two days, probably Monday or Tuesday," he told reporters.An ally of Mr Trump, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, said he did not believe the Crown Prince's denials. "If he is going to be the face of Saudi Arabia going forward, I think the kingdom will have a hard time on the world stage," he told NBC.
