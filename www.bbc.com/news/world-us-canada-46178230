She was among the hundreds of thousands of California residents who have had to evacuate their homes across the state.The wildfire season usually starts in summer and runs into early autumn there, but recent low humidity, dry conditions and warm fast-moving winds have created ideal conditions for blazes to spread. In Paradise, a town north of Sacramento, thousands of buildings have been destroyed and at least 29 people are known to have died, with more than 200 others still unaccounted for.Despite the widespread destruction, some pets have been recovered there alive, giving hope to survivors who are still missing theirs.

        The effort is complicated because often animals caught up in fires flee or hide, especially when injured. Pets lost in fires earlier this year are still being reunited with owners, as volunteers use elaborate baiting techniques to try and recapture the animals. Around Butte County where the November fires have been the most deadly, emergency workers and volunteers, including the North Valley Animal Disaster Group, have been going into the affected areas to give emergency supplies to larger farm animals that had to be been left behind.
