            Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen says she is quitting as leader of the governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) after mayoral election defeats."Our efforts weren't enough and we let down all our supporters," she said.Taiwan's media report that the pro-independence DPP is likely to lose nearly half of the 13 cities and counties it won in 2014.Taiwan's relations with China have deteriorated since Ms Tsai came to power in 2016.Beijing has refused to deal with her because she does not recognise an agreement reached between the two sides in 1992 that both sides are part of one China.

On Saturday, Taiwan was also voting in a referendum on whether to become an Asian first and legalise gay marriage.Its top court has ruled in favour of same-sex marriage, giving parliament two years to amend laws or pass new ones.
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        A simple question of good relationsAnalysis by Cindy Sui in TaipeiDuring campaigning, President Tsai and her administration accused China of meddling in the elections without providing hard evidence, often using the term fake news and promoting her party as protecting Taiwan's democracy. As in previous elections it also tried to fuel fears about China.In the end voters expressed dissatisfaction with her and her party, not only for the sluggish economy, continuing low wages and a wealth gap, but also the worsening of relations with China since she came into power in 2016.The DPP's core supporters are the 30% of Taiwanese who are adamant about independence and want it immediately.But the majority of voters want to maintain the status quo - neither independence nor unification. They simply want good relations with China and peace and prosperity for Taiwan. If President Tsai and her party refuse to change course on China, they risk losing the presidency and their majority rule in parliament in the 2020 election.
