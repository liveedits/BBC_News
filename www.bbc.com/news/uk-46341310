            British academic Matthew Hedges, who was jailed for spying in the United Arab Emirates, has been pardoned with immediate effect.Mr Hedges, 31, denied spying and said he had been researching his PhD, but prosecutors said he confessed. His wife, Daniela Tejada, who appealed for clemency, told Reuters that she "cannot wait to have Matt back home". The UAE said the pardon was part of a series of orders issued on the country's National Day anniversary.
