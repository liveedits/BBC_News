The UAE said the pardon was part of a series of orders issued on the country's National Day anniversary.Ms Tejada told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "It's taken me by surprise and I'm just so happy and so relieved and really incredulous that it is all happening finally.

            However, UAE government spokesman Jabel Al Lamki claimed Mr Hedges had been "using two different identities to gather information from his targets". Mr Hedges would be released as soon as "all formalities" were complete, according to the UAE.Mr Al Lamki added: "In one he was Matthew Hedges the PhD researcher, in another one he was Matthew Hedges the businessman, he was part-time PhD researcher, and part-time businessman, but he was 100% a secret service operative."He said a request for clemency from Mr Hedges' family had been granted "in consideration of the historical relationship and close ties between the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom".University staff's Dubai campus boycott
