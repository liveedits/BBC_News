                    Daniela Tejada previously said her husband was being held in "inhumane and degrading" conditions
                
            However, UAE government spokesman Jabel Al Lamki claimed Mr Hedges had been "using two different identities to gather information from his targets". "In one he was Matthew Hedges the PhD researcher, in another one he was Matthew Hedges the businessman, he was part-time PhD researcher, and part-time businessman, but he was 100% a secret service operative," he added.Mr Al Lamki said a request for clemency from Mr Hedges' family had been granted "in consideration of the historical relationship and close ties between the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom".
