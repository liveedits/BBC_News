        The couple were rumoured to have married in a New York courthouse two months ago, but Hailey Baldwin denied it at the time.
    
        
But it's reported they had a very secret ceremony in September.They unofficially confirmed their marriage in comments on social media last week when the Sorry singer called Baldwin "my wife" and the model changed her name to Hailey Bieber.

Every day is a learning process, trying to be more like him, patient, kind, selfless, boy I got a long way! But gods grace is sufficient!"It's not the first time he has posted about religion.
