What is the migrant caravan heading to US?
The migrants, who are mostly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador, say they are fleeing the threat of violence in their home countries and looking to make a better life for themselves and their families.  They have travelled in large groups, dubbed "caravans", for more than 4,000km (2,500 miles) from Central America and most want to reach the United States, where they say they plan to ask for asylum.
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        Among them are many families with young children.But with US President Donald Trump vowing to keep each migrant on the Mexican side of the border until courts have decided their case, they are facing a long wait.They have been spending the past two weeks in temporary shelters in the Mexican border city of Tijuana and in Mexicali, 180km to the east along the border.

        How did events unfold?A group of at least 500 migrants joined a march from their shelter in Tijuana towards the border on Sunday.

                    The march started peacefully
                
            Mexican Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete said the migrants had asked for help to organise the demonstration but were then reportedly encouraged by some of the movement's leaders to split into different groups so they could make a run for the border and try to cross into the US. The march started peacefully with migrants carrying pro-immigration banners and shouting: "We aren't criminals! We are hard workers!".But once they managed to get past the security cordon, the march quickly turned into a dash for the border, BBC correspondent Will Grant reports.

                    But they were driven back by tear gas
                
            Several hundred managed to climb over the first barrier, according to Agence France-Press news agency. It was as they tried to cross a second, spike-topped wall that officials on the US side began firing tear gas.An AFP journalist saw the migrants - including mothers and children - trying to protect themselves from the gas, with some crying out that they only wanted to find  work and a better life in the US.Associated Press Mexico correspondent Chris Sherman said he had seen parents running away with choking toddlers. Among them was Honduran migrant Ana Zuniga, 23, and her three-year-old child: "We ran but when you run, the smoke smothers you more." US Customs and Border Protection, which polices the border, said its personnel had been assaulted and hit by rocks.

        What was the US reaction?As a result of Sunday's action, the US closed the San Ysidro border crossing near Tijuana to vehicles and pedestrians for a number of hours before re-opening it.The closure caused long delays in both directions and angered people like José Fajardo who lives on the Mexican side of the border but works in the US city of San Diego.

                    The San Ysidro border crossing is the busiest between Mexico and the US
                
            "It's really bad," he told the BBC's Will Grant as he pointed at the backed-up traffic and lines of riot police. "I have to get to work in a restaurant over the other side. I cross the border every day for work. But when you can't work, there's no money."US Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the migrants had tried to harm US border guards "by throwing projectiles at them". She said that her department would "not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons" and that US officials would "seek to prosecute" offenders.Mr Trump threatened to close the entire US-Mexico border earlier this week if it was felt the US was going to "lose control" of the situation. He also said he had given troops at the border the go-ahead to use lethal force if needed.What did Mexico say?Mexico's interior ministry said in a statement that a group of "nearly 500 migrants" had "tried to cross the border in a violent way" at El Chaparral border crossing.Those identified as having taken part in these "violent events" would be deported immediately, he said.The ministry added that, "far from helping their objectives", the migrants' actions had violated the legal migration framework and could have led to a "serious incident".What next for the migrants?With the Mexican authorities saying that those who crossed illegally into the US on Sunday face "immediate" deportation, the mood in the migrant shelter is likely to darken, says the BBC's Will Grant.Many in the migrant caravan are likely to be unsettled by this turn of events, our correspondent says. And with many in the shelters realising how long the wait for asylum could be, some, like Honduran Joseph García, are growing increasingly desperate: "My little girl is sick and I don't even have money for milk. I can't stand it anymore."
