            Matthew Hedges praised his wife and said:  "I thank you all once again, this is very surreal."British businessman David Haigh, who spent nearly two years in a Dubai prison for fraud, which he denied, warned that returning home would not be the end of the matter.The former managing director of Leeds United said: "It's not an acquittal. He is still a convicted spy, so he's going to have all sorts of issues for his life in terms of travel and going forward."But also he was six months in solitary confinement, so that's going to have a lasting effect - I'm sure he saw many horrors."
