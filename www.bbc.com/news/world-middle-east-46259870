            Israel's government appears to have survived a possible collapse after a key partner withdrew a threat to leave the coalition and force snap elections.Naftali Bennett, of the Jewish Home party, had signalled he would quit, but announced on Monday he would stay on.PM Benjamin Netanyahu has held talks with ministers in recent days to try to keep his coalition together.The crisis began when the defence minister resigned in opposition to an Israeli ceasefire with Gaza militants.Mr Bennett had said he would pull his party out unless he was appointed the new minister of defence.
    
        
Mr Netanyahu has assumed the role himself for the time being.
