            The autonomous car that can drive where others cannot
            Researchers at MIT CSAIL have developed an autonomous car that drive on unpaved or unmarked roads. Most self-driving cars rely on 3D maps with precise measurements of lanes and cannot venture onto unmapped roads.But MIT CSAIL's MapLite combines GPS, a normal map and laser sensors which allows the car to drive into more remote areas.BBC Click finds out more.See more at Click's website and @BBCClick.
