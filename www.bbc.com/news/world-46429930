                    Changes affecting ambulance drivers are part of a raft of reforms by French President Emmanuel Macron
                
            Also on Monday, French ambulance drivers staged further demonstrations against a range of social security and healthcare reforms they say could affect their services. Dozens of trucks formed a blockade from Paris's Place de la Concorde to the French National Assembly. One protester told the Reuters news agency:"[The reforms] will bludgeon us financially and destroy our companies. We're going to have to fire people, that's for sure." It is unclear whether the groups of students and health workers have directly aligned themselves with the "yellow vests."

        French media shocked by worst rioting since 1968By BBC Monitoring There is shock and anger in the mainstream French press after "yellow vest" protesters ran riot in Paris neighbourhoods, burning cars and looting shops. Left-wing daily Libération says: "Paris has undoubtedly experienced the most violent rallies since the events of May '68." The paper notes the "heterogeneity" of the protesters - from nationalists and far-right student groups to hard-left militants and anarchists. In an editorial entitled "National emergency", centre-right daily Le Figaro says that 1 December will "remain a collective injury for the nation". It comments that "in the face of this explosion of inexcusable violence", the whole country "had the feeling of witnessing the collapse of the state". Business daily Les Echos says in its headline that President Emmanuel Macron "is facing chaos". "After the violent scenes on Saturday, the Elysée is still looking for a strong political response," the paper notes.Centre-left daily Le Monde speaks of a "major political crisis" and notes that after returning from Argentina, President Macron immediately went to the Arc de Triomphe in central Paris which was a "scene of violence".
