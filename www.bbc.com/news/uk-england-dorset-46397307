        Kaitlyn is due to visit the SWAS's 999 control centre near Bristol later when she will be formally commended for her actions. Mrs Wright said she was "so proud" of her daughter."I just remember Kaitlyn's dad bringing her back to the house and asking if I needed shopping and he went off. The next thing I know the paramedic is looking at me."I have regular seizures so all three children know exactly what to do, we've been very thorough with it."
