            'I fell from the clouds'In recent years police have hit the Cosa Nostra network hard. It was long handicapped by the fact that Toto Riina was in jail, but when he died the Mafia moved to rebuild the cupola without taking orders from a "godfather".Riina was notorious for his brutality. In 1992 two leading prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, were blown up in Mafia hits. Six months later Riina was arrested.Rome police seize mafia luxury villas

Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica says Settimo Mineo was arrested on Falcone's orders in 1984, and told his interrogators: "I don't know who you're talking about, I fell from the clouds." Mineo was jailed for five years in a big Mafia trial based on the Falcone investigation. He was rearrested in 2006 and spent another 11 years in jail.A well-known "pentito" (police informer), Tommaso Buscetta, is reported to have provided intelligence about Mineo.Italian media report that Mineo avoided using a mobile phone and preferred to walk, rather than travel by car. He allegedly ran Mafia operations in Pagliarelli, a central district in Palermo.
