The film is regarded as a cinematic masterpiece and won an Oscar for Kubrick for best visual effects.Rain's chilling, dry voice is key to the drama, but he wasn't the first choice to play the computer.The director originally selected Oscar winner Martin Balsam - but decided he was "too colloquially American".He also considered actor Nigel Davenport in the role, but later concluded he did not want a British voice.Revisiting 2001: A Space OdysseySo he called upon Rain after hearing his voice in the 1960 documentary Universe, according to The New York Times.The actor recorded all his lines in 10 hours over two days, with the director sat "three feet away, explaining the scenes to me and reading all the parts", he said.But, according to the New York Times, Rain never saw the finished film.Stratford Festival's artistic director Antoni Cimolino said the actor shared Hal's intelligence - with added "warmth and humanity".
