What did Maduro say?"John Bolton has been assigned with the job organising my assassination, deploying foreign troops and imposing a transitional government in Venezuela," he told journalists at the Miraflores presidential palace.The Venezuelan people were prepared to fight back, with the help of "friendly countries," he added, Mr Maduro has previously accused the US as well as Colombia and the Venezuelan opposition of plotting to kill him.What was behind the visit by Russian bombers?The US is increasingly concerned by his government's links with Russia, China and other countries that have differences with the Trump administration.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Russian bombers' visit amounted to "two corrupt governments squandering public funds".

            The Russian government called his words "completely inappropriate".The long-range strategic bombers landed at Simón Bolívar airport outside of the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, on Monday along with two other Russian planes.Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said they were part of air force exercises with its Russian allies: "This we are going to do with our friends, because we have friends in the world who defend respectful, balanced relations."The White House said it had been informed by Russia that the bombers would leave Venezuela on Friday. How deep is Venezuela's economic crisis?More than two million people have fled Venezuela since 2014, about 7% of the country's population.Venezuela says the US has waged an economic war to put an end to almost 20 years of socialism in the country.
