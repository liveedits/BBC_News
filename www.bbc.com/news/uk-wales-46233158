            A man is suing British Airways after being "squashed" next to an obese passenger during a 13-hour flight. Stephen Huw Prosser, 51, of Penygraig, Tonypandy, who is 5ft 3in, said he suffered a pelvic injury and nerve damage in his neck on the journey from Bangkok to London in January 2016. He said the passenger "reminded him of the late rugby player Jonah Lomu", Pontypridd County Court heard.He is claiming for damages and loss of earnings, which BA is resisting.

            Mr Prosser, a civil engineer company director, was returning home from a holiday in Thailand on 10 January 2016. 
    
        
He was sat by the window when a "huge man" took the seat next to him before takeoff. Should obese passengers pay more?

"In my opinion he was obese as well as tall. I would estimate he was 6ft 4in in height and in excess of 22 stones," said Mr Prosser. "He had to physically squeeze himself between the armrests. His buttocks were bulging onto my side and the rest of his bulk spilling over."The weight of this man's bulk was pushing my spine in a painful, unnatural and crooked position as I tried to remain in an upright position." 
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        Mr Prosser complained to the cabin crew but was told there was no alternative seat available as the flight was full.He remained in his seat for the rest of the journey but was in "continual pain".Asked if he complained to the passenger, Mr Prosser replied: "I didn't want to get into a confrontation with him."In the weeks that followed, he claimed he remained in constant pain, his stance was "twisted" and suffered back spasms. As a result of this, he said, he was also forced to restrict his working hours for three months and was unable to continue his hobbies of mountain-biking and motorcycling. The BA customer service manager on board the flight, Chris McLindon, said he had "very rarely, if ever" dealt with such a complaint.He added: "The passenger was tall and broad but he was certainly not obese. He didn't overfill the armrest or the confines of the seat."I regularly walked down the aisle and Mr Prosser was not sat in an unnatural position for an economy seat."When Mr Prosser left the aircraft, I watched him walk down the jetty in a perfectly normal manner and showed no signs of injury."He added British Airways does not have a policy where passengers must give their size or weight when booking tickets, however some 'pro-active' passengers, who know they will struggle to fit in one seat, instead purchase two. The case continues.
