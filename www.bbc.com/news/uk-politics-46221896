        A resignation in itself is not a surprise - but the departure of the Brexit secretary might be the domino that causes everything else to fall.It's not just that it was his job to make the policy work. It's because he has just given unhappy Brexiteers someone to rally round, and someone who sees himself as a potential challenger to the PM.After his departure, it becomes extremely difficult for other Brexiteers unhappy about the deal to stay on.And in the last few minutes Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has decided to leave the government.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigns
Reality Check: What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal?
There is speculation about International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt too, although sources close to her say a departure today is far from definite.
    
        
Meanwhile, No 10 is busy trying to explain its policy this morning to opposition politicians and then to Parliament in the next hour.But there have been three resignations from government - Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara was the first to quit - and it's not even 10:00 GMT.It's too early to say if this morning's storm will be a hurricane that will sweep the policy, and maybe the prime minister away.You can hear more on the deal from Laura, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler and BBC Europe correspondent Adam Fleming in an emergency edition of the BBC's Brexitcast Podcast.
