            Cheshire Constabulary said Naude had passed the vetting process in October 2016 but that allegations of sex offences being investigated by two neighbouring forces in early 2017 did not get picked up.Latest news and updates from the West MidlandsDuring his two-week trial, Naude denied rape and sexual assault as he claimed the sex with the 13-year-old girl was consensual and that she "seemed to be enjoying it". The court was told he met the girl after he was called to her house over a domestic incident in October 2017.After looking her up on Facebook and exchanging sexual messages and photos, he returned to her home three days later.He picked her up while her mother was out and drove her to a country lane where he attacked her.

            Naude deleted more than 750 photos from his phone after an "administrative error" meant he had been copied into emails relating to the police investigation into his conduct.He also concealed other devices including a second phone and a laptop in a field in Market Drayton.Cheshire Constabulary said this had "frustrated" and "set back" the investigation.Texts sent by Naude revealed a pattern, always starting conversations with 'Hi, you look pretty and interesting," police said, before quickly demanding nude images and threatening to expose girls to their friends if they refused.

            Cheshire Det Ch Supt Aaron Duggan said Naude "joined police intentionally to commit this type of offending. "We know from our investigation that he's a sexual predator, a groomer and he's also a chancer."Acting Chief Constable of Cheshire Constabulary Janette McCormick said she believed Naude had been working alone but it would be "naive" to think there were not other offenders within the force.She has also said the force is now investigating other potential offences by Naude.Rape accused PC said girl 'enjoyed it'
'Paedophile' PC 'demanded nude pictures'
'Paedophile' PC 'raped teenage girl' 
Judge Clement Goldstone warned Naude he faced a "very significant sentence" and that even his defence conceded he had been "fairly depicted... as a cold, uncaring, selfish and cruel paedophile".An NSPCC spokesperson said it was "evil" of Naude to "shamelessly label it [the rape] consensual".Naude will be sentenced on 13 December.
