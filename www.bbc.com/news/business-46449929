US-China trade row: What has happened so far?
Ahead of the statement from China, President Trump sounded optimistic, but reiterated his tough stance."President Xi and I want this deal to happen, and it probably will. But if not remember, I am a Tariff Man," Mr Trump said on Twitter. "When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so."The US President said China was supposed to begin buying US agricultural products and others "immediately" as part of an agreement to reduce the trade imbalance between them.However, there are some discrepancies in what the US is saying and what was in the brief statement from Chinese officials.While Mr Trump said talks with China and the 90-day truce period had already started, China did not clarify when the 90-day period was supposed to begin.Also, China's commerce ministry made no mention of the car tariff cuts which Mr Trump said earlier this week China had agreed to.Mr Trump said this week on Twitter that Beijing had agreed to "reduce and remove" tariffs the 40% tariffs it places on US cars.The BBC's Robin Brant in Shanghai said China's comments put it at odds with the White House.China has pledge to implement the changes agreed at trade talks between Presidents Trump and Xi "as soon as possible", but it has not repeated claims from senior figures in the US that it will happen "immediately", he said.
