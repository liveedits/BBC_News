            Seal slaps man with octopus in NZ
            A man has been filmed being slapped in the face with a large octopus thrown by a seal. Kayakers off Kaikoura in New Zealand were trying to capture the sunbathing seals looking "cute", but nothing was standing in the way of this animal's lunch.
