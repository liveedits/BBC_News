    What do you know about Africa's 'looted treasures'?

        

    
        During colonial rule in Africa, thousands of cultural artefacts were seized from the continent by western countries. But on Friday, France is launching a report calling for thousands of African artefacts in its museums to be returned to the continent. This comes as major museums across Europe have agreed to loan key artefacts back to Nigeria.

                            The Rosetta Stone was the key to unlocking the lost hieroglyphic script of ancient Egypt. But who discovered the mighty slab (750kg), now held in the British Museum, in 1799?
