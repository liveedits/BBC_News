Who has written no confidence letters? 
It is not yet known how quickly the result of the vote will be announced, but Mrs May needs to get a majority in her favour to win it.If that happens she cannot be challenged for at least another year.If Mrs May does not win the vote there would then be a Conservative leadership contest in which she could not stand. There is also an option that even if Mrs May won - but not overwhelmingly - she may decide to stand down as party leader.

        Media captionThe BBC's Iain Watson on what Theresa May faces nowBecause the Conservative Party is the largest party in the House of Commons, whoever is leader of the party would be expected to be prime minister.If Mrs May is ousted as Conservative leader later she would be expected to stay on as a caretaker prime minister until a new leader is selected by the party, a process that could take six weeks.If there are multiple candidates, Conservative MPs hold a series of votes to choose two to go forward to a vote of party members.Sir Graham Brady, chairman of backbench Tories, who is overseeing the vote, said: "We are looking at the leadership of the party and clearly the prime minister remains until there is a successor."Justice Secretary David Gauke told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would not expect a new leader to be in place until late January or February - meaning they would have to ask the EU for more time to negotiate Brexit."If she loses tonight whoever is prime minister will have to delay Article 50. I cannot see how we can possibly leave on 29 March."
