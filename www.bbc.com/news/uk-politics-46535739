Who has written no confidence letters? 
It is not yet known how quickly the result of the vote will be announced, but Mrs May needs to get a majority in her favour to win it.
    
        
If that happens she can not be challenged for at least another year.If Mrs May does not win the vote there would then be a Conservative leadership contest in which she could not stand. There is also an option that even if Mrs May won - but not overwhelmingly - she may decide to stand down as party leader.Because the Conservative Party is the largest party in the House of Commons, whoever is leader of the party would be expected to be prime minister.
