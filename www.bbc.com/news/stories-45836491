            Suicide in Northern Ireland: 'I have no sons left'
            Northern Ireland has the highest suicide rate in the UK. The latest available figures show that the rate there is nearly double that in England. Since the Good Friday Peace Agreement in 1998, more people have died from suicide in Northern Ireland than were killed by violence during the Troubles. Patricia Ferrin says her family has been "destroyed" after each of her three sons took their own lives.
