            Accepting the award, she said: " "I hope one day our country will be recognised and treated as a truly independent entity. This is my biggest wish as a Taiwanese." Taiwan's status is sensitive. The island has been self-ruling since 1949 but China regards it as a breakaway province it will reunite with one day.
