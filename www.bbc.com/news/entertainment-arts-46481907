Despite its title, the Kanye West track is the longest on the new album, clocking in at three minutes, 17 seconds.West opens the song saying: "So much hate at the top, it's a lonely place."And he later says: "Now your name is tainted by the claims they paintin'/The defendant is guilty, no one blames the plaintiff."The lyrics have led fans to suggest West is not only directly addressing the charges against the late rapper, but also defending himself against criticism he has faced.The controversy hasn't affected the support from XXXTentacion's passionate fanbase, who have been sharing their thoughts about the new album on Twitter.

Skins also includes the previously released single Bad.Fans also praised the second track Guardian Angel, which features a sample of the 2017 song Jocelyn Flores played in reverse. The song is dedicated to Jocelyn Amparo Flores, a 16-year-old fan who went to Florida to meet the rapper and committed suicide during the trip.
