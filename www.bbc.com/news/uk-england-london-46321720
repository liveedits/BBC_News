Met Police Commander Amanda Pearson said "a lot of them [scooter riders] get up and run away and look aghast as if to say 'how dare we'". She added: "It's a high impact tactic and therefore our riders and our drivers will be considering the risk to the rider that they are pursuing, the risk to the public and the risk to themselves. "But in more cases than not it is safer to bring that pursuit to a close than it is to continue to allow that rider driving dangerously through London."
