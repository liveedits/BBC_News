The couples in the final performed a dance of the judge's choice, a show dance and their favourite dance of the series.The judges chose the foxtrot for Stacey and Kevin's first dance. The pair then performed the show dance to Land of a Thousand Dances by Jessica Mauboy, and their choice was the Paso Doble - or "Paso Dooley".Strictly stars on how it's changed their lives
What makes a Strictly winner?
Beyond Today: Stacey Dooley
Although judges Craig Revel-Horwood, Dame Darcey Bussell, Shirley Ballas and Bruno Tonioli gave their scores as usual, the winners were decided purely by a public vote.Stacey and Kevin would have actually come fourth out of the four final pairs if it had just been down to the judges, who awarded them a score of 114 out of a possible total of 120.

            Two couples - Pussycat Dolls star Ashley and partner Pasha Kovalev, and Steps singer Faye and Giovanni Pernice - were given top marks for all three dances in the final, getting 120 out of 120.But some viewers were less impressed by their achievements because Ashley and Faye had previously had dance training and experience, whereas Stacey and Joe were relative novices when they started.

This year's series was as eventful as ever - off the dancefloor as well as on it.It hit the headlines when comedian Seann Walsh was caught kissing his married dance partner Katya Jones outside a pub.There were also reports of a row between actor Danny John-Jules and his dance partner Amy Dowden during training.
