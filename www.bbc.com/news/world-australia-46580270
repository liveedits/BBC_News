        The weather system is expected to reach the North Queensland towns of Ingham and Innisfail by early Sunday. Meteorologists predict it will move back out over water before tracking down the state's east coast.  Australia frequently experiences extreme weather, with flash floods, sandstorms and droughts in some areas.Last month, Queensland was hit by destructive bushfires which forced the evacuation of thousands of people.
