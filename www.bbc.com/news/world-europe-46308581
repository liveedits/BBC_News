Mr Loyen had previously considered giving up base jumping, which involves jumping from fixed objects with a parachute and is one of the riskiest extreme sports."Yes, I had some thoughts about taking a break, or giving it up completely, when a good friend of mine had a fatal accident," he told Deutsche Welle in 2014."But then you deal with it, and somehow you have to do what you find fun. You worry about it and then decide to carry on anyway and you swear not to make the same mistakes."
