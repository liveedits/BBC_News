        High winds, snow and freezing rain have hit parts of the UK as Storm Deirdre swept in, bringing travel disruption and power cuts.The Met Office said up to 50cm (20in) of snow fell in the Highlands and wind gusts reached 70mph on the Welsh coast.Multiple crashes because of icy conditions were reported by police overnight on Saturday and hundreds of homes lost power in Scotland and Wales.The Met Office said the freezing rain had mostly cleared, but ice was likely.It warned that melting snow and rain due on Monday could create a risk of "localised flooding".
