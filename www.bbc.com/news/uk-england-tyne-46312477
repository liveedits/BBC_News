            A British academic, convicted of spying in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and jailed for life, is "absolutely terrified", his wife says.Daniela Tejada said she had had "five minutes" on the phone with Matthew Hedges for the first time since his sentencing and he is "not well".Hedges, 31, denied spying and said he had been researching his PhD. Prosecutors said he confessed.The UAE ambassador is due to give an update on the case at 10:00 GMT.BBC diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams tweeted that things were "looking a bit more positive" for Hedges, with Foreign Office sources suggesting there had been an "olive branch" from the Emirati foreign minister.

                    Daniela Tejada previously said her husband Matthew Hedges was being held in "inhumane and degrading" conditions
                
            Ms Tejada, who was in the court when her husband was sentenced, said: "He is not well."He is just absolutely terrified at the idea of having to spend the rest of his life behind bars for an offence he hasn't committed."His panic attacks have become worse than they were before, however he did say he has access to a doctor."I don't know yet whether he has been able to have access to the prescription he had been given during this time of bail, which was working wonders for him."I wasn't allowed to know where he is, we still don't know anything about his whereabouts."Why is the UAE's legal system being criticised?

        Media captionDaniela Tejada says she "can't win this fight alone"Political scientist Hedges, who is originally from Exeter, had been in the country conducting research on the UAE's security strategy for his PhD thesis when he was arrested at Dubai airport.Prosecutors said he had confessed to spying.The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the country was "determined to protect its important strategic relationship with a key ally" and added it hoped both sides could find "an amicable solution" to the case.The country's Attorney General Dr Hamad Saif Al Shamsi previously said Hedges had the right to appeal.Abdulla Al Naqbi, head of the ministry's Department of Legal Affairs, had said that "families also have the right to appeal for presidential clemency on behalf of convicted relatives".In a statement, Mr Al Naqbi said "compelling and powerful evidence was presented in court" and that this included Mr Hedges' own confession. Hedges was offered, and accepted, the services of a court-appointed lawyer and was also provided with translators, he said."It is not true that he was asked to sign documents he did not understand," Mr Al Naqbi said.
