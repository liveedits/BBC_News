Mr Hunt met Ms Tejada in the wake of her criticism of the UK government for failing to take a firm enough stance with the UAE.However, speaking afterwards, Ms Tejada thanked the foreign secretary for "taking the time" to meet her at "this crucial point".Hedges, a political scientist at Durham University who is originally from Exeter, had been in the country researching the UAE's security strategy for his PhD thesis when he was arrested at Dubai airport on 5 May.The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the country was "determined to protect its important strategic relationship with a key ally" and added it hoped both sides could find "an amicable solution" to the case.
