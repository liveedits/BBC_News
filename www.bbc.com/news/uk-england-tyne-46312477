        Media captionUAE spy row: Jailed student 'suffering panic attacks'Ms Tejada, who was in the court when her husband was sentenced, said: "He is not well."He is just absolutely terrified at the idea of having to spend the rest of his life behind bars for an offence he hasn't committed."His panic attacks have become worse than they were before, however he did say he has access to a doctor."I don't know yet whether he has been able to have access to the prescription he had been given during this time of bail, which was working wonders for him."I wasn't allowed to know where he is, we still don't know anything about his whereabouts."More than 160,000 people have signed an online petition set up by Ms Tejada. Why is the UAE's legal system being criticised?

Analysis: 'Release possible within days'By BBC diplomatic correspondent Paul AdamsYesterday was a remarkable day.It started off with the UAE ambassador going to the Foreign Office and getting what we think was quite a dressing down from Jeremy Hunt, who has made his fury at this life sentence very clear indeed.And then in the afternoon, following a statement from the UAE Foreign Ministry about the two sides working towards some kind of amicable solution, there was another conversation, this time with the FM of the UAE, which Mr Hunt said had been "constructive". He believed the FM was working hard to resolve this as soon as possible.So the tone dramatically changed in just a few hours, and the impression I am getting from both sides is that they are now working assiduously and with some urgency to try and get this sorted out, possibly very soon.There is the possibility that one of the mechanisms that authorities in the UAE have identified is the possibility of the family seeking clemency, that those wheels may be in motion, and that may be the route that secures Matthew Hedges' release within a matter of days.Mr Hunt met Ms Tejada in the wake of her criticism of the UK government for failing to take a firm enough stance with the UAE.However, speaking afterwards, Ms Tejada thanked the foreign secretary for "taking the time" to meet her at "this crucial point".Hedges, a political scientist at Durham University who is originally from Exeter, had been in the country researching the UAE's security strategy for his PhD thesis when he was arrested at Dubai airport on 5 May.The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the country was "determined to protect its important strategic relationship with a key ally" and added it hoped both sides could find "an amicable solution" to the case.UAE officials said Hedges could appeal within 30 days and his family also "have the right to appeal for presidential clemency".They said Hedges was given a court-appointed lawyer and translators, and "compelling and powerful evidence was presented in court", including his own confession.
