            He said they couldn't wait to bring "more scares, more monsters and more Bradley Walsh, Mandip Gill and Tosin Cole" - referring to the Doctor's companions.Lizo Mzimba, the BBC's entertainment correspondent, said while there was "a recognition that fans might want a series every single year, Doctor Who has almost uniquely complex filming requirements and a lengthy post-production period". He added that the New Year's Day episode could have been planned so that 2019 "won't be a totally Doctor Who-free year". The episode on 1 January marks a change in Christmas tradition, as it will be the first time Doctor Who hasn't been shown on Christmas Day.
