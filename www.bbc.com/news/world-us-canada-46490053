            The arrest has put further strain on US-China relations. The two countries have been locked in trade disputes, although a 90-day truce had been agreed on Saturday - before news of the arrest came to light on Wednesday. Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second-biggest smartphone maker after Samsung.Ms Meng's arrest was not revealed by Canadian authorities until Wednesday, the day of her first court appearance.Details of the charges were also not revealed at the time after she was granted a publication ban by a Canadian judge.On Thursday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government was told about the arrest a few days beforehand, but it did not play a role."I can assure everyone that we are a country [with] an independent judiciary," he said.
