            Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, is facing fraud charges relating to alleged breaking of US sanctions on Iran, a Canadian court has heard.Details of the charges were revealed when a publication ban was lifted by a judge in Vancouver. Ms Meng, daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in the city on Saturday and faces extradition to the US.The court is deciding whether or not to allow bail.On Friday, US prosecutors told the court that Ms Meng had used a Huawei subsidiary called Skycom to evade sanctions on Iran between 2009 and 2014.
    
        
They said she had publicly misrepresented Skycom as being a separate company.
