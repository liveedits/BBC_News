A number of Western countries condemned Russia's actions and President Poroshenko warned the threat of a Russian land invasion was "extremely serious".In New York, the United Nations Security Council met to discuss the crisis - but failed to agree a Russian-proposed agenda amid sharp disagreements between Moscow and the West.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that the seizure of Ukrainian ships was a "dangerous escalation and a violation of international law". President Donald Trump said: "We do not like what's happening, either way we don't like what's happening and hopefully they'll get straight."Taking a call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Vladimir Putin argued that the Ukrainians had "deliberately ignored the rules of peaceful passage in the territorial sea of the Russian Federation", the Kremlin said.What will martial law mean?After heated debate in Ukraine's parliament, 276 lawmakers backed a decision to impose martial law on 10 of Ukraine's 27 regions:Five regions border Russian territory

                    President Poroshenko said the authorities needed firm power in case of a full-scale Russian invasion
                
            Monday's vote in parliament came after an emotional address by President Poroshenko, who promised not to restrict basic freedoms. Some MPs expressed fears Mr Poroshenko could suspend a presidential poll on 31 March 2019 - a claim he firmly denied.But he stressed he needed firm power in case of a full-scale Russian invasion.Ukraine's national security and defence council had initially recommended a 60-day martial law. But Mr Poroshenko said he amended the proposal because he did not want martial law to affect the presidential elections.Still, critics expressed fears that Mr Poroshenko - whose ratings have plummeted in recent months - could suspend the elections to stay in power.What happened on Sunday?This is the chronology of the dramatic events that led to the naval clash: In the morning, Ukraine said it had sent two gunboats and a tug from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Mariupol in the Sea of Azov 
Ukraine's navy then said Russian boats had tried to intercept its vessels, ramming the tug 
Russia accused Ukraine of illegally entering its territorial waters 
Russia scrambled fighter jets and helicopters as the Ukrainian vessels approached a bridge over the Kerch Strait - the only access to the Sea of Azov 
The bridge itself was blocked by a tanker 
In the evening, Ukraine said its vessels had been fired on and seized by the Russians. Six Ukrainian crew members were injured 
Russia confirmed it had used weapons to force the Ukrainian vessels to stop, saying three Ukrainians were injured 

                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        Russia said the Ukrainian ships were in its waters illegally because Moscow had temporarily closed an area of water for shipping.Kiev called Russia's actions a flagrant violation of international law, because the Black Sea is free for shipping, and Crimea belongs to Ukraine.Ukraine also cited a 2003 Russia-Ukraine treaty on unimpeded access to the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov.It said it had informed the Russians in advance of its plan to move its ships to Mariupol - a claim denied by Russia.In recent weeks, two Ukrainian vessels passed through the Kerch Straight without incident. The crisis as it happenedWhy is this happening now?There have been growing tensions between the two sides over navigation in the area. Russia has recently begun inspecting all vessels sailing to or from Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov.
