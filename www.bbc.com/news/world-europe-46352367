Eastern Ukraine: A new, bloody chapter
A number of Western countries condemned Russia's actions.In New York, the United Nations Security Council met to discuss the crisis - but failed to agree a Russian-proposed agenda amid sharp disagreements between Moscow and the West.What is the latest?After heated debate in Ukraine's parliament, 276 lawmakers voted in favour of martial law covering:Nine regions bordering Russian territory

Thirty lawmakers voted against the move.The vote came after an emotional address by President Poroshenko, who promised not to restrict basic freedoms.But he stressed he needed firm power in case of a full-scale Russian invasion.What happened on Sunday?This is the chronology of the dramatic events that led to the naval clash: In the morning, Ukraine said it had sent two gunboats and a tug from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Mariupol in the Sea of Azov 
Ukraine's navy then said Russian boats had tried to intercept its vessels, ramming the tug 
Russia accused Ukraine of illegally entering its territorial waters 
Russia scrambled fighter jets and helicopters as the Ukrainian vessels approached a bridge over the Kerch Strait - the only access to the Sea of Azov 
The bridge itself was blocked by a tanker 
In the evening, Ukraine said its vessels had been fired on and seized by the Russians. Six Ukrainian crew members were injured

        Russia said the Ukrainian ships were in its waters illegally because Moscow had temporarily closed an area of water for shipping.Kiev called Russia's actions a flagrant violation of international law, because the Black Sea is free for shipping, and Crimea belongs to Ukraine.Ukraine also cited a 2003 Russia-Ukraine treaty on unimpeded access to the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov.It said it had informed the Russians in advance of its plan to move its ships to Mariupol - a claim denied by Russia.In recent weeks, two Ukrainian vessels passed through the Kerch Straight without incident.

        'A difficult balance'By Jonathan Marcus, defence and diplomatic correspondentThe incident in the Black Sea is a powerful reminder that the tensions between Russia and Ukraine are not part of a frozen conflict: they can flare up with very little warning. Nato and Ukraine's allies in the West have strongly backed President Poroshenko. But what can they do to influence Russian behaviour? There will be talk of more economic sanctions. But Russia is already heavily sanctioned, and this has not encouraged it to rethink its annexation of Crimea. There will be calls for additional support for the Ukrainians; Nato countries provide training for Kiev's military - they could presumably do more. And the Trump administration, even before this episode, was already considering calls to sell additional weaponry to Ukraine in addition to the Javelin anti-tank missiles already supplied.But there is a difficult balance to be struck between support for Ukraine's territorial integrity on the one hand and avoiding anything that might tip the conflict into full-scale war. 
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        Why is this happening now?There have been growing tensions between the two sides over navigation in the area. Russia has recently begun inspecting all vessels sailing to or from Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov.
