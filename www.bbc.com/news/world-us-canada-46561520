        The US Senate has voted to withdraw US military aid for Saudi Arabia's war on Yemen and to blame the kingdom's crown prince for the murder of a journalist.Members of President Donald Trump's Republican party joined Democrats by 56-41 to rebuke the longtime US ally over reporter Jamal Khashoggi's death.Mr Trump has vowed to veto the largely symbolic measure, and it is unlikely to pass the House of Representatives.Experts say Yemen is experiencing the world's worst humanitarian crisis.The non-binding "war powers resolution" also calls on Saudi Arabia to "moderate its increasingly erratic foreign policy".
    
        
The US chose to cease refuelling Saudi war planes last month, and Thursday's resolution - if it were passed into law - would prohibit that practice from resuming.The measure is seen as politically embarrassing to Mr Trump because he has refused to condemn Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite the CIA's assessment that he probably personally ordered the killing of Khashoggi, a US resident.Truce breakthrough in Yemen talks

            Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who supported the measure, described it as "a historic moment"."Today we tell the despotic government of Saudi Arabia that we will not be part of their military adventures," he said. He said the vote is a signal to "the world that the United States of America will not continue to be part of the worst humanitarian disaster on the face of the earth".
