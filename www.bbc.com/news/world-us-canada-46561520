        The US Senate has voted to withdraw US military aid for Saudi Arabia's war on Yemen and to blame the kingdom's crown prince for the murder of a journalist.The historic vote is the first time any chamber of US Congress has agreed to pull US forces from a military engagement under the War Powers Act.Some of President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans defied him to pass the measure with Democrats by 56-41.But the resolution is seen as largely symbolic and unlikely to become law.Senators rebuke Trump with Yemen vote
Jamal Khashoggi: The story so far
What did the Senate actually do?The non-binding "war powers resolution" calls upon President Trump to remove all American forces engaging in hostilities in Yemen, except for those combating Islamist extremists. 
    
        
The Senate then unanimously passed a resolution blaming Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for reporter Jamal Khashoggi's murder in October, and insisting that the kingdom hold accountable those responsible.The US chose to cease refuelling Saudi war planes last month, and Thursday's resolution - if it were eventually passed into law - would prohibit that practice from resuming.The measure is seen as politically embarrassing to Mr Trump. He has stood by the Saudi crown prince despite the CIA's conclusion that he probably ordered the killing of Khashoggi, a troublesome critic and Washington Post journalist.

            What did senators say?Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who co-sponsored the measure with Republican Mike Lee of Utah, hailed the vote."Today we tell the despotic government of Saudi Arabia that we will not be part of their military adventures," he said. He described the outcome as a signal to "the world that the United States of America will not continue to be part of the worst humanitarian disaster on the face of the earth".Republican Senator Bob Corker, who attended a CIA briefing on Khashoggi's killing on Thursday, told MSNBC: "If he was before a jury, the crown prince, he would be convicted in my opinion in 30 minutes."

Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has continued to cultivate ties with the prince, according to the US media.Truce breakthrough in Yemen talks

        What's the latest in Yemen?Earlier on Thursday, the warring sides met in Sweden where they agreed to hold a ceasefire in the port city of Hudaydah, a key entry point for aid and food imports.After the deal was reached, negotiators for both parties shook hands to applause, though they later expressed scepticism. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he hoped this would be the starting point to bring nearly four years of civil strife to a close.Since hostilities began in 2014, thousands of civilians have been killed, and around 14 million people have been pushed to the brink of starvation, according to the UN.Saudi Arabia buys the bulk of its weapons from the US, Britain and France.
