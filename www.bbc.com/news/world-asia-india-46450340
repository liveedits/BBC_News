        Speaking to People magazine, Chopra said the wedding was a "religious mash up", adding that they "took beautiful traditions that we both grew up with and personalised them in a way that makes sense for us."Jonas, 26, and Chopra, 36, got engaged in the summer, not long after news of their romance became public.They have since said in an interview that they first started exchanging texts in September 2016. They appeared together at the Met Gala in May 2017 as they had both been dressed by Ralph Lauren, and their relationship started making headlines around a year later.Chopra is one of Bollywood's highest-paid actresses, having won the Miss World pageant in 2000 and going on to make more than 50 films in India.She broke into acting in the US with a part in the TV series Quantico and film roles in Ventilator, Baywatch and A Kid like Jake.
