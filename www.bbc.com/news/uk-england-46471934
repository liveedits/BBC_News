            The helicopter which crashed killing Leicester City's chairman and four others span out of control after a mechanism became disconnected, investigators have said.An Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) report found cockpit pedals had disconnected from the tail rotor. This caused the aircraft to turn uncontrollably to the right before it crashed near the King Power Stadium.The AAIB said its inquiries into the 27 October crash are ongoing.
