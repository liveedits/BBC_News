        Chris "Brolga" Barns, who said he had set up the sanctuary to house Roger and "a couple of his wives", said the marsupial had been their alpha for many years. 
    
        
"He grew up to be a kangaroo that people from all over the world have grown to love as much as we love him", he said.

The clucking noise he is making is telling me to get away from his lady kangaroos. And the red on his neck is a scent that males rub onto trees etc to mark their territory.

        Mr Barns said Roger had been buried in the park so "he will always be here".Roger first came to the world's attention in 2015 when images of him crushing a metal bucket in his hands using his huge muscles went viral. In his later years he had struggled with arthritis and fading vision, but was "loving his retirement", Mr Barns said in 2016.In the wild, kangaroos live for about 10 years but can live longer in captivity.
