                Of course her colleagues in govt relieved that she can try to carry on but it's a survival not success tonight - another big knock to the PM's credibility, and no solution at all to the gridlock in Parliament - she's survived, her brexit compromise can't in its current formâ€” Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) December 12, 2018

The confidence vote was triggered by 48 of her MPs angry at her Brexit policy, which they say betrays the 2016 referendum result.How have Conservative MPs reacted?Jacob Rees-Mogg, who led calls for the confidence vote, said it was a "terrible result for the prime minister" and called on her to resign.Andrew Bridgen, who voted against Mrs May, said it was "huge opportunity missed to reset our Brexit negotiations with a new prime minister" and there was a risk of "stalemate" in Parliament.But former senior minister Damian Green said it was a "decisive" victory for the prime minister, which should allow her to "move on and get on with the job in hand". Cabinet minister Chris Grayling said: "This has hardly been a joyful day for the Conservative Party but it has voted very comfortably that it wants her to stay, wants her to take us through Brexit."

        Media captionMay survives confidence voteThe result was greeted by cheers and applause from Tory MPs as it was announced by backbench Tory chairman Sir Graham Brady.The prime minister still faces a battle to get the Brexit deal she agreed with the EU through the UK Parliament, with all opposition parties and, clearly, dozens of her own MPs against it.What are the opposition saying?Labour frontbencher Rebecca Long-Bailey said: "This deal that she has on the table will not get through Parliament."She said Labour would table a no-confidence motion that all MPs - not just Conservatives - will be able to vote in when they felt they had a chance of winning it, and forcing a general election.The SNP's Stephen Gethins urged Labour to "step up to the plate" and call a vote of no confidence in Mrs May, accusing the government of "playing games with people's lives". DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said his party, which helps keep Mrs May in power, was still concerned about the Irish backstop plan, which most MPs were against."I don't think this vote really changes anything very much in terms of the arithmetic," he told BBC News.But he said the DUP would not support a no-confidence motion in Parliament at this stage. PM pledges not to fight next electionMrs May earlier vowed to fight on to deliver her Brexit deal, which she argues is the only option for leaving the EU in an orderly way on 29 March.But in a last-minute pitch to her MPs before the vote she promised to stand down as leader before the next scheduled election in 2022.While "in her heart" she wanted to fight another election as leader, she realised her party did not want her to. However, she resisted calls to put a firm date on her departure. If she had lost the confidence vote Mrs May would have been forced to stand down as Conservative Party leader, and then as prime minister.But she is now expected to travel to a summit in Brussels on Thursday to continue trying to persuade EU leaders to change the deal - they have previously said it can not be renegotiated.The outcome of the vote was welcomed by Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who said avoiding a no-deal exit from the EU was their "shared goal".
