Mr DeSantis - a staunch supporter of US President Donald Trump and his policies - replied to the tweets, saying it was now "time to bring Florida together".The recount has been controversial. Mr Trump and Republicans have claimed voter fraud without offering any evidence.Mr Trump had also said there was "a lot of dishonesty" over contested votes. Again, he offered no evidence.
