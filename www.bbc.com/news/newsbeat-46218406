        Little Mix have posed naked with offensive words written all over their bodies to promote their new single Strip.Words likes "slutty", "ugly" and "talentless" are scrawled across their strategically covered bodies. In a post on Instagram, the band said Strip was "all about standing proud".They said it was written to "encourage and empower people to be who they are". And their fans seem to love it.The lyrics include: "Jiggle all this weight, yeah you know I love all of this// Finally love me naked// Sexiest when I'm confident."
    
        
"We're talking about stuff we've wanted to speak about for ages," Jesy says. "We've all suffered from body confidence and negative comments, and up until now we didn't really have a song we felt addressed everything we needed to."
