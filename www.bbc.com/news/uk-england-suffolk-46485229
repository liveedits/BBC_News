            A man captured on CCTV and believed by a missing airman's mother to be her son has identified himself to detectives.Police viewed the footage during their investigation into Corrie Mckeague's disappearance from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in September 2016.His mother Nicola Urquhart said the public would be "horrified" to see it, as it cast doubt on the police theories over her son's whereabouts.Police said the man captured on CCTV had been traced.The BBC asked for the CCTV footage to be released under the Freedom of Information Act.
    
        
Suffolk Police turned down the request on the grounds of data protection laws and because it could prejudice the Â£2.1m investigation.

The tragedy that shaped Corrie Mckeague
Missing airman 'may have dodged CCTV'
Mrs Urquhart said she had viewed CCTV footage which she said showed a man leaving the bin loading bay.She said the footage was "grainy" but it showed a person "wearing incredibly bright, reflective clothing, which looks like white trousers". Mrs Urquhart said she believed it was her son and if members of the public saw the footage "no-one would believe he went in the bin".
