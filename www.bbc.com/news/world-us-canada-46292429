            A man's "shout-out" to a child who left a note on his damaged car, telling him a school bus driver was to blame, has been widely shared on Twitter.Andrew Sipowicz, from Buffalo, New York, found the handwritten note on his vehicle, which read "Bus 449 hit your car", alongside a drawing.The sender only identified themselves as a sixth grade student, but Mr Sipowicz took to Twitter to thank her for saving him "thousands" of dollars in repair bills.Explaining what happened in her note, the child said: "She [the bus driver] was trying to pull off and hit the car. She hit-and-run."The 21-year-old's car owner's tweet has since been liked more than 500,000 times.
