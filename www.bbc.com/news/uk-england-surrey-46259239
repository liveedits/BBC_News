A spokesman from Reigate and Banstead police said: "Unfortunately the officers parked in a resident's bay in a rush to get into an address.
    
        
"When the officers finished at the address and spoke to the person who put the note on their car, they explained they were responding to an emergency."The Facebook post has been shared more than 800 times and has more than 1,000 comments.Mike Howell said: "Total lack of respect for the emergency services. Bet whoever placed this note required police officers asap, they sure wouldn't mind if police parked in their front garden.
