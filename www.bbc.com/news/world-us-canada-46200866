Ms Singh said she is not "particularly proud" with some of recent content and needs time to reflect the kinds of videos she wants to create. YouTuber Lilly Singh generously gives fans cash for rent, exams and food"The thing about YouTube is, in all of its glory, it kind of is a machine and it makes creators believe that we have to pump out content consistently even at the cost of our health and our life and our mental happiness," she said. Ms Singh said she is not permanently leaving the platform and  is not sure of how long she will be away. "I'm not making any rules. This might be a one week break, this might be a one month break - I have no idea," she said. The 30-year-old comedian and actress began her YouTube channel in 2010.
