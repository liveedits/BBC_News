            Some zoo visitors tweeted images from the scene including Sophie Flynn, who said staff were "working hard to deal" with the fire, which "happened very quickly". "It started as a little fire... which we saw but it's obviously much worse now!"David Clough, who lives across the road from the zoo, said: "We first saw signs of the fire shortly after 11.30 GMT."He added: "It was spreading across the roof in strong winds for a while."Lots of fire engines arrived quickly."We were very worried for the people and animals that would have been in the building."

        Flames were fanned by today's very strong winds and raced across the roof of the Monsoon Forest enclosure.As hundreds of visitors were being evacuated from the wider premises, zoo staff were leading threatened animals to safety.The zoo has closed and we have no indication of when it will reopen.Of course an investigation has begun into the cause of the fire.Even though visitor numbers would have been much lower on a day of bad weather like today, this is obviously a very dramatic event for one of northern England's premier attractions.The Monsoon Forest habitat is the UK's largest zoological building, according to the attraction, and opened as part of the zoo's islands section in August 2015. The 14-acre section houses Sumatran orangutans, rhinoceros hornbills, crocodiles and a variety of plant species. It has its own tropical weather conditions, with temperatures reaching 26.6C to replicate conditions in South East Asia.
