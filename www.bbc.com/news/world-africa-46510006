            When you think of professional wrestling you probably think of the big American promotions like WWE. But there are local pro-wrestling associations around the world, including in South Africa.We went to meet Cindi Gold, a 19-year-old from Soweto, Johannesburg, who trains with the African Punishment Wrestling Association (APWA). We followed her preparation for a big match and heard about her dream to build a career in the sport and to encourage other young black women to get involved.Video journalist: Chris Parkinson
