Her extravagant lifestyle turned her into a hate figure in the years leading up to the French Revolution, when many French people could barely afford to feed their families.She smuggled out her jewellery to her family in Austria before her failed attempt to flee France with Louis XVI and their children. France's last queen was guillotined in 1793 at the age of 37.
