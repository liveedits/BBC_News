It had been valued at about $2m.It was part of a major collection of jewellery sold by Italy's royal Bourbon-Parma house.Some of the jewels had not been seen in public for 200 years. The previous record for the most expensive pearl jewel was a necklace once owned by the late Dame Elizabeth Taylor. It was sold for $11.8m at Christie's auction house in 2011.

            There were also pieces from King Charles X, the Archdukes of Austria and the Dukes of Parma, including a diamond tiara.The whole collection was sold for more than £53m.Marie Antoinette was an Austrian princess before her marriage to France's King Louis XVI. Her extravagant lifestyle turned her into a hate figure in the years leading up to the French Revolution, when many French people could barely afford to feed their families.She smuggled out her jewellery to her family in Austria before her failed attempt to flee France with Louis XVI and their children. She was guillotined in 1793 at the age of 37.
