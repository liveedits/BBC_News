                Just over 200 days ago, you, the people of Ireland voted to repeal the 8th so we could care for women with compassion. Today we have passed the law to make this a reality. A vote to end lonely journeys, end the stigma and support women’s choices in our own country— Simon Harris TD (@SimonHarrisTD) December 13, 2018

Irish Health Minister Simon Harris tweeted his support for the latest developments.The Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy Bill allows for abortion services to be provided "on demand" up to the 12th week of a pregnancy, in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality or where the physical or mental health of the mother is in danger.Since the bill's introduction at first stage in October, there have been some minor changes, including a decision to review the legislation after three years, rather than five years as was originally planned.Two different doctors will be allowed to assess a woman in early pregnancy and the offences section has been moved from the front of the bill.
