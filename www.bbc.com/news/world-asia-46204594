[and] those affected by the use of atomic weapons," said Big Hit Entertainment, the agency representing the band.

        The photos started to go viral, prompting criticism by the Jewish human rights group the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, which said the symbol depicted on the hats were of the Nazi SS Death Head logo."It is clear that those designing and promoting this group's career are too comfortable with denigrating the memory of the past... the management should publicly apologise," said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, a director at the Simon Wiesenthal Centre.Big Hit told the centre that the hat which had caused offence had been given to the singer to wear by a stylist at a magazine photo shoot in 2014.In its lengthy Facebook apology, Big Hit Entertainment stressed that it "does not support any organizations or groups oriented towards political extremism and totalitarian beliefs including Nazism" and that the band were "in no way responsible for any of the issues outlined".
