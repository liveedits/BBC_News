        Media captionTheresa May: 'We now need to get on with the job of delivering Brexit'Theresa May is heading to Brussels for an EU summit, the morning after surviving a vote of confidence.The prime minister is seeking legally binding pledges from EU leaders on the Irish backstop - a key obstacle for MPs who oppose her Brexit deal. The EU will not renegotiate the deal but may be willing to give greater assurances on the temporary nature of the backstop, the BBC understands.The PM won the ballot on her leadership by 200 votes to 117 on Wednesday night.The secret ballot was triggered by 48 of her MPs angry at her Brexit policy, which they say betrays the 2016 referendum result.
    
        
Live: May heads to Brussels after vote winSpeaking in Downing Street after the vote, Mrs May vowed to deliver the Brexit "people voted for" but said she had listened to the concerns of MPs who voted against her."I have heard what the House of Commons said about the Northern Ireland backstop and, when I go to the European council tomorrow, I will be seeking legal and political assurances that will assuage the concerns that members of parliament have on that issue," she said.But Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said, despite the "high drama" of Wednesday, "nothing has really changed".He told BBC News: "We are still back with the problem that the government has a proposal that we can't get through Parliament and we have got to try and break that gridlock." What will happen at the EU summit?Earlier this week, the prime minister travelled to meet EU leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte to raise the issues surrounding the withdrawal agreement at Westminster one-on-one.But a trip to meet the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had to be cancelled because of the leadership vote.At Thursday's summit, Mrs May will have an opportunity to spell out face to face the problems to all leaders of the 27 member states.The EU leaders will then consider what could be done - without Mrs May in the room.  What next for Theresa May?
How did we get here?
For or against? How Tory MPs said they would vote
Brexit: A really simple guide
A draft of the European Council conclusions on Brexit says the EU would use its "best endeavours to negotiate and conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the backstop so that it would only be in place for a short period and only as long as strictly necessary."In other words, the EU would continue trying to negotiate a trade deal with the UK even if the Irish backstop had been triggered at the end of the transition period.The Brexit withdrawal agreement only talks about "best endeavours" being used to reach an agreement during the transition period.But the draft put forward by the European Council could be subject to change, the BBC's Adam Fleming says.Westminster critics of Mrs May's Brexit deal might also complain that it is not legally binding.But the same document reiterates that the withdrawal agreement is not open to renegotiation, adding that it would not have been even if the Conservative Party had changed leaders.In a phone call between President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker and Mr Varadkar on Wednesday, the pair reiterated that the deal on the table was "a balanced compromise and the best outcome available", and "cannot be reopened or contradicted".

                Of course her colleagues in govt relieved that she can try to carry on but it's a survival not success tonight - another big knock to the PM's credibility, and no solution at all to the gridlock in Parliament - she's survived, her brexit compromise can't in its current formâ€” Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) December 12, 2018

The outcome of the vote was welcomed by Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who said avoiding a no-deal exit from the EU was a "shared goal". But Mrs May still faces a battle to get her Brexit deal through the UK parliament, with all opposition parties and dozens of her own MPs against it.How did MPs react?A split was still clear in the Tory Party after the result. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who led calls for the confidence vote, said losing the support of a third of her MPs was a "terrible result for the prime minister" and he urged her to resign.Brexit-backing Tory MP Mark Francois told the BBC it was "devastating" that more than half of backbenchers not serving in the government had abandoned the prime minister.But Nicholas Soames urged Brexiteers to "throw their weight" behind the PM as she sought to address the "grave concerns" many MPs had about aspects of the EU deal.

        Media captionBrexit battles: How May lived to fight another dayLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the vote had "changed nothing".His party has said it will table a no-confidence motion that all MPs - not just Conservatives - will be able to vote in when they felt they had a chance of winning it, and forcing a general election.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said his party, which helps keep Mrs May in power, was also still concerned about the Irish backstop plan, telling BBC News: "I don't think this vote really changes anything very much in terms of the arithmetic."But he said the DUP would not support a no-confidence motion in Parliament at this stage.
