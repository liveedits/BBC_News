            China has demanded that Canada release Ms Meng or face consequences. She is scheduled to appear on Tuesday in the Supreme Court of British Columbia for the third day of her bail hearing. Her husband has offered C$15m ($11m; Â£9m) -  C$1m in cash and the couple's two homes in Canada - as surety for Ms Meng's release. Canadian Crown prosecutors have asked for bail to be denied because they believe the wealthy executive poses a flight risk. China's foreign ministry also insisted on Tuesday that Canada failed to promptly notify Beijing immediately about Ms Meng's arrest, according to a state media report.
