            Canada's foreign ministry says it is trying to make contact with a second Canadian who is believed to have been detained in China on suspicion of harming national security. Businessman Michael Spavor had contacted Canadian officials this week to say he was being questioned. A Canadian ex-diplomat was arrested in China earlier this week. On 1 December, Canada arrested an executive with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, at the request of the US.The Americans are seeking the extradition of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer (CFO) of Huawei, on suspicion of violating US sanctions on Iran.

Who are the two Canadians? Michael Spavor is a businessman based in Dandong, near the Chinese border with North Korea. He has deep ties to the North Korean government. Ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig currently works for a think thank, the International Crisis Group (ICG), which has said it is concerned for his health and safety.Both men were apparently detained following the arrest of Ms Meng although after the detention of Mr Kovrig, Canada said there was currently no "explicit indication" of any link.Canadian officials said the reason for Mr Kovrig's detention remained unclear while Chinese state media have reported that he is being held "on suspicion of engaging in activities that harm China's state security". At a news conference in Ottawa on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Mr Kovrig's case had been raised directly with Chinese officials.

            Foreign ministry spokesman Guillaume Bérubé confirmed that Mr Spavor was "presently missing in China" after Ms Freeland said a second Canadian had contacted them earlier in the week because "he was being asked questions by Chinese authorities".Canada is working hard to determine Mr Spavor's whereabouts, Mr Bérubé said,China state media confirmed on Thursday that, as with the previous arrest, Mr Spavor was under investigation on suspicion of "engaging in activities that endanger China's national security".Mr Spavor runs an organisation called Paektu Cultural Exchange, which organises business, culture and tourism trips to North Korea.

            He is a regular visitor to North Korea and regularly comments in the media on Korean issues. He is particularly well known for helping to arrange the visit by former NBA star Dennis Rodman to North Korea in 2013. Rodman is a personal friend of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. One of Mr Spavor's last tweets, on Sunday, said he was about to travel to Seoul in South Korea, but he did not arrive on Monday as planned. Ms Meng was granted bail on Tuesday for  C$10m (£6m; $7.4m) bail but could still be extradited to the US.
