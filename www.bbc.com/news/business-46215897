Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director general, said: "It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal.""Securing a transition period has long been firms' top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest."The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said agreement on the draft was a "milestone" but said business still needed clarity and precision on the specific terms of trade they will face.Dr Adam Marshall, BCC director general, said businesses would need to look carefully at the "real-world" implications of the agreement.He said the agreement could represent "the end of the beginning - but not yet the beginning of the end" of uncertainty.
