            Yasar, who was born in Turkey and arrived in Denmark at the age of four, had led the Copenhagen-based criminal gang Los Guerreros - a notorious gang with links to the drugs trade, according to police. He quit the gang in 2012 to join an exit programme after he discovered that he was going to be a father, Danish news agency Ritzau reported.

        Yasar's memoir, "Roots: A Gangster's Way Out", is written by Marie-Louise Toksvig and describes Yasar's journey as he pulls himself out of the criminal underworld. Denmark's Justice Minister, SÃ¸ren Pape Poulsen, described Yasar's death on Tuesday as "sad and infinitely meaningless". "I met Nedim once. I met a man who with all his heart wanted to create a new life and make a difference for others. My thoughts and compassion go to his friends and family," Mr Poulsen tweeted.Denmark has experienced an increase in gang-related shootings in recent years. A record number of shootings were reported last year, police said.
