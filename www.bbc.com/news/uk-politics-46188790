                    Ministers have been briefed on the state of the negotiations
                
            A "small number of outstanding issues" stand in the way of a Brexit agreement, Downing Street has said after Theresa May updated her cabinet on the talks.There remains "optimism on both sides", government sources have said, as negotiations continue in Brussels.But Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC "difficult discussions" were still going on about the Irish border issue. Ministers, meanwhile, have said they will publish a "full legal statement" before MPs vote on any agreement. The undertaking was given as the government faced near certain defeat in the Commons over whether to publish the legal advice it gets about the terms of the UK's withdrawal.

The Democratic Unionists, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, said they would vote for Labour's motion urging full disclosure of "any advice" given by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox to the cabinet.An influential group of Tory Brexiteers also said they would not oppose the move and abstain in a vote on the issue later on Tuesday. During a 45-minute discussion on Brexit, the cabinet were briefed on the state of the negotiations, as well as planning for different scenarios ahead of the UK's scheduled exit on 29 March, 2019.No 10 said the prime minister had told colleagues progress had been made since the last cabinet meeting a week ago but there were a "small number of outstanding issues as the UK pushes for the best text" and work was continuing.

The BBC's Norman Smith said it was thought the only "substantive" area of disagreement left was over the mechanism for the UK to exit the proposed "backstop" customs arrangement - referring to the fallback plans to guarantee there will be no new visible checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.On Monday night, some cabinet ministers met for drinks in Mr Fox's office to discuss Brexit, including no-deal plans and the Irish "backstop". Mr Fox told the BBC's Iain Watson there were "still issues" with the backstop and negotiators were having a "number of difficult discussions". The prime minister is under pressure from both Brexiteers and pro-EU MPs as she tries to seal a deal with the EU on the terms for the UK's exit,Another late nightBBC Brussels reporter Adam FlemingThe negotiating teams stayed up late again, but not as late as on Sunday. At issue is the mechanism for terminating the Northern Irish backstop - if it's ever used. Should it be a decision for the EU-UK joint committee that will be set up to manage the Brexit treaty or for a separate arbitration panel where UK and EU representatives would be joined by an independent figure from somewhere else? There is also a tussle within the EU27 over Britain's idea for a UK-wide customs arrangement as an alternative to the EU's Northern Ireland-only option. Some member states see this as giving access to the single market, which should be accompanied by guarantees on other things such as fishing rights and environmental standards. The European Commission has tried to reassure them, saying it is still only an insurance policy - not the final trade deal - and that it's just a way to get the British cabinet to approve the Brexit treaty. Laura Kuenssberg: Delay or decision?Both the UK and EU want to schedule a special summit of European leaders at the end of November to sign off the withdrawal deal, but time is running out.Brussels says it will only agree to put the wheels in motion for the summit if agreement can be reached on the issue of the Irish border.If a deal can be reached with the EU in time, Mrs May will then need to persuade her party - and the rest of Parliament - to support it in a key Commons vote.
                
                
                
                
                
            
            
        Following pressure from all sides of the House of Commons, ministers have agreed to provide MPs with a legal assessment of the implications for the UK of the backstop and other controversial aspects of any deal.Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Mr Cox, who is the government's senior legal adviser, would make a statement to MPs and take questions ahead of the final vote on any Brexit deal.He told the Commons "we will make available to all members of the House, following the conclusion of negotiations and ahead of the meaningful vote, a full reasoned position statement laying out the government's both political and also legal position on the proposed withdrawal agreement".

The concession reflects the wording of a compromise amendment supported by a number of Tory members of the European Research Group which was not selected for debate. In a speech on Monday evening, Mrs May said the "endgame" in the negotiations had been reached and while both sides wanted an agreement, the issues at stake were "immensely difficult". But Boris Johnson, who quit as foreign secretary in July in protest at Theresa May's strategy, hit out at what he claimed was a "stage-managed delay" in reaching an agreement.
