            Nottinghamshire Police said it was following "a number of lines of inquiry" but attention was focused on the recovered car.Richard Edgcumbe, curator of jewellery at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, described the jewelled headpiece as "one of the great historic tiaras of Great Britain".James Lewis, from Bamford auctioneers in Derby, said it had been "designed in a period when money was no object".Mr Lewis said: "It could be worth millions - but it is such a well-known piece it can't come up for public sale."The most horrendous thought is it could be something called a 'breaker', where the diamonds are taken out and sold individually."You may also like:Graffiti menace is 'not Les Dennis'
