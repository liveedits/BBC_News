        A Chinese scientist who claims to have created the world's first genetically edited babies has defended his work.Speaking at a genome summit in Hong Kong, He Jiankui, an associate professor at a Shenzhen university, said he was "proud" of his work.He said "another potential pregnancy" of a gene-edited embryo was in its early stages.His claims, which have caused widespread outrage, have yet to be independently verified. Prof He said eight couples - comprised of HIV-positive fathers and HIV-negative mothers - had signed up voluntarily for the experiment; one couple later dropped out.
    
        
He added that he had initially funded the experiment by himself. It was first announced earlier this week that Prof He had altered the DNA of embryos - twin girls - to prevent them from contracting HIV.His claims were widely criticised by other scientists, who called the idea monstrous.Such work is banned in most countries.China baby gene editing claim 'dubious'
