            Former US First Lady Michelle Obama has shared some words of wisdom with the Duchess of Sussex about adjusting to life in the spotlight. "Like me, Meghan probably never dreamt that she'd have a life like this," Mrs Obama told Good Housekeeping Magazine."The pressure you feel - from yourself and from others - can sometimes feel like a lot," she went on."So my biggest piece of advice would be to take some time and don't be in a hurry to do anything.""I spent the first few months in the White House mainly worrying about my daughters, making sure they were off to a good start at school and making new friends before I launched into any more ambitious work. I think it's okay - it's good, even - to do that," Mrs Obama continued.

The Duchess of Sussex is due to give birth next spring, and recently announced she and her husband will move into their home in the grounds of Windsor Castle to prepare.
