Russia must also pay all costs incurred by the work of the IAAF's task force.It is the ninth time the IAAF has turned down Russia's appeal for reinstatement.The ruling means Russian athletes will not be able to compete under their own flag at the European Indoor Championships in February.However, athletes who have met the IAAF doping review board's drug-testing criteria will be allowed to compete under a neutral flag in Glasgow.More to follow.
