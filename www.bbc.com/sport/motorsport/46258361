Surviving was incredible," said Frits van Amersfoort, the owner of Van Amersfoort Racing.
    
        
"We reckon she was travelling at 276km/h (171.6mph) at the time."Florsch posted on social media on Sunday to say she will have surgery on her broken vertebrae on Monday.She hit the back of Jehan Daruvala's car on lap four and then launched over the inside kerb into the car of Sho Tsuboi. That impact catapulted her car over the barrier and into an area occupied by marshals and photographers.Van Amersfoot described the 20-minute period that followed as "one of the worst of my life"."We got some information from social media while we were waiting at the door of race control, but when you look at those images it is heartbreaking so we were thinking of the worst," the Dutchman told BBC Radio 5 live."It took quite a long time before the race control could say anything about the health of Sophia - everyone can imagine that's not a nice thing to have."I don't think I've ever seen anything like this. I haven't seen all accidents in motorsport but this was surely one of the worst I've ever seen."We were lucky that she was flying because she went over a barrier. If she had hit the barrier it would have gone a lot worse."'How the crash happened'
