Vergne took second with Jerome d'Ambrosio third, while Felipe Massa finished 14th on his Formula E debut.Oliver Rowland was the highest-finishing of the five British drivers in seventh, followed by Sam Bird in 11th."It's amazing, it's been tough, it's been long months of work and I am really happy with that," said Da Costa."We have got some work to do, but a good start and we will work on that and keep it going."Da Costa set the early pace, despite a messy start from pole where the Portuguese driver overshot his starting position and began the race at an angle.Vergne produced a smart overtake with 26 of the 45-minute plus one lap race to go, but the TECHEETAH driver dropped back after being handed a drive-through penalty.Da Costa, Massa, Stoffel Vandoorne, Lucas di Grassi and Daniel Abt were the top five drivers to receive a fan boost, as voted for by viewers using an app to determine who gets some extra power during a race. The new 'Attack Mode' also saw drivers take additional risks by moving off the racing line and on to a different area of the track, where the mode is activated to provide the car with a temporary power boost.A yellow flag with 10 minutes remaining saw leader Da Costa reeled back in, producing a flat-out finish after the race restarted with three minutes on the clock.Da Costa activated his Attack Mode off the back of the safety car to quickly re-open a two-second lead and then just about held off a resurgent Vergne.Formula E - the cool kid on the block?
