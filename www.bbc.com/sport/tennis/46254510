                Alexander Zverev beats Novak Djokovic to win the ATP Tour finalAlexander Zverev stunned world number one Novak Djokovic in straight sets to win the season-ending ATP Finals and earn the biggest victory of his career.Djokovic, 31, was the heavy favourite to win a sixth finals title but was outclassed 6-4 6-3 by the German.Third seed Zverev broke Djokovic for a 5-4 lead in the first set and then served three big aces to take the set.
    
        
Zverev, 21, continued to dominate in the second set and sealed a memorable victory as Djokovic faltered.Zverev lost to the Serb in straight sets in the round-robin stage but, after beating Roger Federer in Saturday's semi-finals, produced a more confident performance to stop Djokovic winning a record-equalling sixth end-of-season title.Zverev missed his first championship point before hitting a sensational backhand down the line for victory, falling to the court in a mixture of disbelief and celebration as Djokovic jumped over the net to congratulate him. Djokovic rattled by courageous ZverevZverev has long been heralded as the young player most likely to carry the mantle for the men's game once the likes of Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray have retired, with the 6ft 6in German's booming serve, crunching groundstrokes and improved play around the net showing he has all the facets needed to reach the very top.Against Djokovic he also showed strong mental resilience and staying power in gruelling rallies to prove he is the real deal.A high-quality opening set remained on serve in the opening eight games, both players only managing to win three receiving points up to then, before a stray forehand from Djokovic - a rare unforced error this week - brought the first break point of the match in the following game.Djokovic landed a deep first serve but when it came back over to his side of the court could only crack a forehand into the net. For the first time in the match - and in the tournament - Djokovic had lost his serve.The true test for Zverev was to keep his nerve and serve out for the first set, a question answered by the German firing down three aces.A volley into the net checked him briefly but he took his second set point when Djokovic went long with a backhand after a short rally.The Serb had not lost a set all week but had not faced the sustained pressure Zverev was putting him under.Time for Zverev to shine at the Slams?Another break point came Zverev's way in the opening game of the first set after he outlasted Djokovic in a 26-shot baseline rally and although he could not convert that, he did take a second opportunity.But he lost his focus in the next game, producing two double faults - the only ones in the match that far - as Djokovic immediately broke back. Any thoughts that might swing the momentum back to the Serb proved unfounded, Zverev breaking again to hold a lead which he would not relinquish.Djokovic, who had won 35 of his previous 37 matches, suddenly lost the control he had shown all week and was unable to make Zverev serve out for victory as the German broke again to win in one hour and 19 minutes.Now Zverev's next challenge is to show he can perform over the five-set format at the Grand Slams.This year he reached his first Grand Slam quarter-final at the French Open and it looks only a matter of time - especially with eight-time major champion Ivan Lendl now in his corner - that he will go deeper into the biggest tournaments.Recent ATP finals2017: Grigor Dimitrov beat David Goffin2016: Andy Murray beat Novak Djokovic2015: Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer2014: Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer2013: Novak Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal2012: Novak Djokovic beat Roger FedererAlerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone
