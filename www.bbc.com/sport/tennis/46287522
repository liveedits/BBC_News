                Highlights: Dominant Zverev beats Djokovic to win ATP FinalsZverev is back up to fourth after the weekend, when his performances forced 57-year-old Nadal - who retired as his nephew's coach at the end of the 2017 season - into a rethink."For some time I had my doubts about whether the youngsters would be able to overcome the game of Federer on grass, the one of Djokovic on fast courts and the one of Rafael on clay," he said."And I had the impression that the change would be caused rather by the decline of some than by the attack of others. The final in London has made me think about it."For now, for the coming year, I trust in the full physical recovery of Rafael. I feel new episodes of his rivalry with Djokovic and, in general, a more open panorama with the definitive incorporation of the new generation."Andy Murray: How the Scot is using handstands to gear up for the new season
