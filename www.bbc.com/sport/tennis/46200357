This was a completely different Federer to the one who had looked frustrated and grouchy against Nishikori in his opening round-robin match on Sunday.And it was not just his mood that had improved considerably; his statistics had too.Gone were the 34 unforced errors - instead a much more disciplined 11 - and with that a superb rate of 86% of first-serve points won and 81% of second-serve points.He looked more like his old self and was helped by Thiem's errors, summed up when the Swiss sealed victory after the world number eight hit a forehand long. More to follow.
