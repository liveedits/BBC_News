South African Anderson had already won two matches to reach the semi-finals.Top seed Djokovic is already through to the semi-finals and can clinch top spot in his group by beating Marin Cilic on Friday. Alexander Zverev, John Isner and Cilic are battling for the other semi-final berth.Federer v Anderson as it happenedStandings, results & BBC coverageIncentives to play in ATP Cup - DjokovicQuestions were asked about Federer's form and state of mind after he lost to Kei Nishikori in straight sets on Sunday but he gave himself a chance of reaching the semi-finals by beating Dominic Thiem on Tuesday.And after Thiem defeated Nishikori earlier on Thursday, the Swiss knew he needed to win only six games to join Anderson in the semi-finals."I'm very happy, my first match was tough and I never got going, but with my back against the wall maybe it's easier for me to play," said Federer."Kevin's had a great year, but it's been a fun group and I'm very happy to be in the semis."Federer had three break points on Anderson's formidable serve in the seventh game and secured the break when the world number six double-faulted.Surprisingly Federer shanked two shots to lose his serve in the next game but the Swiss broke again to love as Anderson temporarily lost his range.Federer had to save three break points at 5-4 but held his serve to take the set - much to the delight of the majority of the fans inside the 02 Arena.The 20-time Grand Slam winner looked back to near his best in the second set, playing nearer the baseline and moving his opponent around.And Federer went on to get a small measure of revenge for his Wimbledon quarter-final defeat at the hands of Anderson by wrapping up victory in one hour and 16 minutes."These round-robin formats are not straightforward, we're used to it being you lose, you leave, you don't hang around," added Federer."Maybe it was difficult for Kevin having already qualified, whereas with Thiem winning it was maybe easier for me."But I'm happy I'm still alive and hope I can play a good match the day after tomorrow."Today's scores, schedule and resultsAlerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone
