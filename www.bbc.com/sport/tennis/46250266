The 14-time Grand Slam champion has not dropped a set all week."I think it was the best match I've played so far this week," Djokovic said.Zverev beats Federer to reach final'I hope ball boy doesn't have sleepless night'Djokovic serves up a masterclass Widely seen as the best returner in the game, 14-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic has in fact been notable for his impeccable serving this week.He is yet to be broken in four matches - facing just two break points - and it took Anderson until the sixth game of the opening set to win his first point on the Serb's serve.The South African only won a total of seven points on the Djokovic serve in the entire match.Where Anderson delivered big serves that averaged more than 130mph, Djokovic's were around the 114mph mark but were all about accuracy, placement and setting up the next shot.He beat Anderson 6-4 on aces - no mean feat against a player so known for racking up the aces that he has been donating money to charity for each one this week.And his total of first-serve points won was a huge 85%.Asked in his on-court interview if it was some of the best serving he has ever produced, Djokovic replied: "Possibly. It is not very common to serve more aces than Kevin. That stat helps the confidence."More to follow.
