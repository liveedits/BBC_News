An encounter between one of the best servers on the Tour in Isner and the best returner was an intriguing prospect, but it was soon clear who would have the upper hand.Isner is a player synonymous with tie-breaks - so impenetrable is his serve - but Djokovic already had him under pressure in the opening game with a break point.Although he netted his shot to squander the chance, he made no mistake in the fifth game when he broke with a beautiful baseline return from yet another thundering first serve from the American.Djokovic's own serving was impeccable, winning six of his service games to love, to give Isner no chance of a breakthrough.He sealed his first break in the second set when Isner netted a forehand in the seventh game and then set up three match points on Isner's next service game - eventually wrapping up victory on the third one with a fantastic backhand crosscourt winner after one hour 13 minutes."I had three breaks of serve of John which is sometimes 'mission impossible' but I managed to be at right place at the right time," said Djokovic."I held serve well, I backed it up from the baseline, I played very solid and didn't give him many opportunities."Group Gustavo KuertenW-LSetsGamesNovak Djokovic1-02-012-7Alexander Zverev1-02-014-12Marin Cilic0-10-212-14John Isner0-10-27-12AnalysisGB Davis Cup captain Leon Smith on 5 live sports extraNovak Djokovic is as good as ever.
