Cilic saved a match point at 5-4, but Zverev clinched victory in the breaker.Zverev, like he did in the first-set tie-break, raced into a comfortable lead in the second decider, taking the second of five more match points with a serve out wide which Cilic could not return.World number one Novak Djokovic aims to move level with Zverev at the top of Group Gustavo Kuerten by beating American John Isner in Monday's evening match at the season-ending tournament (20:00 GMT).Live scores, schedule and resultsAlerts: Get tennis news sent to your phoneCilic still not feeling at home in London Despite reaching Grand Slam finals and cementing his place in the world's top 10 over the past couple of years, Cilic has never managed to make an impact at the end-of-season finals.One win in his three previous appearances at the O2 is a meagre return for a player of his undoubted ability and he was hoping to improve his fortunes with an opening win against Zverev.Yet he paid the price for a sloppy display against the world number five in a match which lacked real quality on either side of the court.After digging deep to hold serve in the first game, Cilic was rewarded for his determination by breaking in the second but missed three chances to go a double break up at 4-0 and 5-1.Ultimately that proved costly for the world number seven.Still he was left serving for the set at 5-3, only to gift the break back to Zverev with three unforced errors and a double fault, allowing the German to take the first set in the tie-break.A low first-serve percentage and more unforced errors continued to blight Cilic's progress in the second, despite him moving a break up for 4-3 after saving a break point in the previous game with a 137mph serve.He handed the advantage back to Zverev in the next game - and that proved decisive.Zverev, without reaching his highest level, managed to cut out the errors in the key moments and took control of the second tie-break to win in two hours and six minutes.Group Gustavo KuertenW-LSetsGamesAlexander Zverev1-02-014-12Marin Cilic0-10-212-14Novak Djokovic0-00-00-0John Isner0-00-00-0'Great match for Zverev to come through' - analysisTim Henman, former British number one and BBC Sport analyst:There were a lot of errors in that match, it seems like the ball is difficult to control on this court. I think there were 80 unforced errors between them and Cilic made more, he was up to about 45 errors. When it came to the business end of both sets Zverev was able to cut down the unforced errors.His first-serve percentage was a bit higher - around 60% - whereas Cilic was under 50%, and for a guy whose serve is a weapon that is not good enough.For Zverev, it was a great match to come through because he did not play particularly well.More to follow.
