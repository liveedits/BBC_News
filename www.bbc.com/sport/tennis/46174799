World number one Novak Djokovic opens his campaign against John Isner at the O2 Arena in London on Monday.Federer hit 34 unforced errors - and was given a warning by the umpire for swiping a ball into the stands in the first set - in a performance that he will be keen to forget. He will be back in action on Tuesday when he faces Dominic Thiem, who lost to Kevin Anderson earlier on Sunday.It is the fourth time Federer has lost his opening match at the event, but he can take some comfort from the fact that in 2007 he still went on to win the title.Frustrated FedererFederer began the match calmly and he put pressure on the Nishikori serve in the fourth game, taking him to deuce. But as his errors began to mount, his mood visibly soured.Nishikori looked like he would run away with the tie-break, forging a 6-1 lead before Federer clawed it back to 6-4, but the Swiss then sent a forehand into the net to hand the set to the Japanese player. The 20-time Grand Slam champion grew increasingly frustrated with himself, while Nishikori simply grew in confidence.Having traded early breaks in the second, the Japanese player broke in the sixth game to go 4-2 up and then served to love in the following game. More Federer errors gave Nishikori three match points and one final mis-hit forehand way beyond the baseline handed him victory.AnalysisFormer British number one Tim Henman on BBC TVThe way Federer has played throughout his whole career, he has made it look ridiculously easy. Tonight has not been easy and it's a shock for people to see.I said before the match, for Nishikori to win, Federer had to play way below par and that's what happened.Federer never found his rhythm from the back of the court. Nishikori is not a great server, but Federer didn't make a break point in the first set.Time and time again we saw errors from the back of the court and not getting his feet into the right areas.BBC tennis correspondent Russell FullerFederer had won his last 11 round-robin matches at the ATP Finals, but produced an erratic performance which hugely complicates his passage to the semi-finals. After Nishikori recovered from 5-6 0-30 down with the help of an extraordinarily athletic backhand half volley to win the first set on a tiebreak 7-4, he was the stronger and more confident player. Serving and volleying at opportune moments, Nishikori ended a run of six consecutive defeats against Federer.
