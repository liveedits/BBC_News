Bratches said he was having "productive conversations" and was "cautiously optimistic we can do something".Bratches said he was hoping to take advantage of what he called "the Max factor".This has seen huge numbers of Dutch fans travelling to other European races, most notably this year Austria, Hungary and Belgium, to cheer on their new hero.'We don't want robots in F1' Horner defends Verstappen after Brazil crash Writing lines?
