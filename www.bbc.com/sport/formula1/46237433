Renault say their target is to ensure the team can "race with the best and contest the title" by 2021.Koskas' appointment comes at a time when many senior figures in F1 believe Renault face existential questions about their participation in the sport.They are currently spending about 60-70% of the budgets of world champions Mercedes and their closest competitors Ferrari and Red Bull.And while Renault will finish the 2019 season best of the rest in fourth place, their car has been on average nearly 1.7 seconds a lap slower, and at times has been lapped by the Red Bulls, which this year use the same Renault engine as the factory team.Ghosn was initially sold on the idea of Renault owning their own team again on the basis of spending no more money than their current budget.F1 bosses are in the midst of talks with the teams aimed at introducing cost control and a budget cap, but that is unlikely to be in operation on any significant level in time for 2021.Renault could therefore face the difficult choice of either accepting they are unlikely to catch the top three teams at their current level of spending, increasing their budget to a level they did not initially want to, or waiting for the the cost-control measures to kick in and accepting that they might take longer to achieve their targets.Red Bull to switch from Renault to Honda from 2019 seasonSingapore GP: Toto Wolff criticises Renault over Esteban Ocon U-turn
