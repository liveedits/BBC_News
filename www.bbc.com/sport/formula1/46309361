"It could have been much worse," said the Red Bull driver on Thursday.Speaking at a news conference before the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi, Verstappen added: "What do you expect me to do? Shake his hand and say 'thank you very much for making me second instead of first'? I think it is quite a normal response."We are all emotional and at the time I had lost a victory. Pushing, in any sport, it happens. I actually saw it a few days ago in football again. So from my side, I thought it was quite a calm response."Esteban Ocon 'tainted by brainless move' - PalmerAbu Dhabi Grand Prix previewPredict your top three at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix

I was after an apology and I got a bit of a different response," Verstappen added."But if you understand the whole conversation you will see it as a bit different. He said something that I didn't expect to hear. It doesn't matter what it was."I don't expect to crash with a backmarker. If you get hit like that, I honestly don't understand what I should do differently."Ocon, who will not be driving in Formula 1 in 2019, said: "It's not a great thing to be involved with a crash with the leader. It's not a thing you want to see and I'm sorry for Max."It was his race to win, he did a fantastic job during the whole race. We have to move forwards in what happened. We can't change the past."How to follow the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on BBC SportBBC Sport has live coverage of all the season's races on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, plus live online commentary on the BBC Sport website and mobile app - including audience interaction, expert analysis, debate, voting, features, interviews and video content.All times GMT.
