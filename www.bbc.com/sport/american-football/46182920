                Drew Brees passes Brett Favre to go second in all-time touchdown passes listThe New Orleans Saints continued their run as the most in-form team in the NFL and quarterback Drew Brees reached another milestone as they enjoyed a dominant 51-14 victory at the Cincinnati Bengals.Brees moved on to 509 career touchdown passes to move above Brett Favre and sit behind only Payton Manning on 539 in the all-time list.And the Saints proved the are genuine Super Bowl contenders by following up last week's win over the previously unbeaten LA Rams.
    
        
It was the joint-worst defeat in Bengals history and the second-most points they ever conceded as they became the first team in the Super Bowl era to allow 500 yards in three straight games.With running backs Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara, wide receiver Michael Thomas and even Brees himself scoring in the six-touchdown romp, New Orleans moved on to 8-1 for the season to match the Rams and Kansas City Chiefs as the only NFL teams with just one loss."We just found our swag, we found our stride," said Kamara after the win. "This team is persistent, consistent, we take advantage of opportunity."We execute and we make sure we handle our business, from top to bottom, no matter who's in. Everybody knows their role and plays their role. Nobody's trying to one-up each other."The Saints have another big game next week as they welcome Super Bowl champions Philadelphia to New Orleans.Watch the NFL Show on BBC iPlayer Roethlisberger throws five touchdowns in Steelers winWho wins Osi & Jason's NFL mid-season awards?NFL week 10: Rams respond, Chiefs roll on and Patriots lose
