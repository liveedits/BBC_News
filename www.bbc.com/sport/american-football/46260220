Questions will be asked of head coach Doug Pederson if they become just the seventh Super Bowl winners to slump to a losing record the following season.
    
        
The Saints are looking one of the most likely sides to replace the Eagles as Super Bowl champions as they topped 40 points for the sixth time in 10 games - another NFL record."It blows my mind, too, trust me," said Saints defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins. "I think everybody knows how special we can be and everyone knows the end goal. If everybody here isn't thinking Super Bowl then they're in the wrong locker room."Brees was at the helm when the Saints won their only Super Bowl in 2009 and, on current form, he could them back to the big game in February - a few weeks after his 40th birthday.Watch the NFL Show on BBC iPlayerAl Pacino?

                Roethlisberger runs for game-winning touchdownThe Pittsburgh Steelers produced a remarkable comeback to beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 20-16 in the final seconds, despite being held scoreless for almost 43 minutes.Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger dived over the goal-line with five seconds left on the clock to complete a 20-point surge from Pittsburgh. It sealed a sixth win in a row and condemned the Jacksonville Jaguars to a sixth straight defeat.The Baltimore Ravens kept in touch with the Steelers as young quarterback Lamar Jackson marked his first start by helping them win their divisional scuffle with the Cincinnati Bengals.Although a quarterback, Jackson is a superb runner and carried the ball 27 times while throwing just 19 times. Baltimore leaned heavily on his scrambling ability to win 24-21, ending a three-game losing streak and taking them above the Bengals in the standings.The Los Angeles Chargers lost for just the third time this season, beaten 23-22 at home by divisional rivals Denver after a last-second field goal from Broncos kicker Brandon McManus.Andrew Luck, the Indianapolis Colts quarterback, extended his run of success against the Tennessee Titans to 10-0 and maintained his incredible touchdown run in a 38-10 victory to put his team in the play-off picture at 5-5.

                The Houston Texans' Justin Reid's interception touchdownIn the AFC South, the Colts are still behind the Houston Texans, who made it seven wins in a row with a tight 23-21 victory at the Washington Redskins - who lost quarterback Alex Smith to a horrific leg injury.Things are hotting up in the NFC play-off race after Brett Maher kicked a 42-yard field goal for the Dallas Cowboys as time expired against the Atlanta Falcons. The Cowboys' 22-19 win kept alive their season but just about ended the Falcons' hopes of playing the Super Bowl in their home stadium.The Detroit Lions are well out of it but dealt the play-off hunting Carolina Panthers a blow with a one-point win. The Panthers lost 20-19 after their coach Ron Rivera's unsuccessful attempt to grab a two-point conversion in the final minute instead of kicking the easier one-pointer that would have sent the game to overtime.In the NFC North, the Chicago Bears are surprise leaders, and look a decent bet to make the post-season after a tough 25-20 victory over the Minnesota Vikings at Soldier Field.

                Oakland Raiders quarerback Derek Carr had a heated discussion on the sideline during the win over ArizonaThere should be a close relationship between a quarterback and his head coach, but every so often temperatures flare on the sidelines - as Derek Carr and John Gruden showed during the Oakland Raiders game.Gruden has struggled since returning to the NFL from the broadcast booth on his whopping $100m deal, failing to get the best out of the talented but underperforming Carr at quarterback.The angry exchange of words may have actually helped in this case, though, as Oakland actually managed to win the game against Arizona.
