Dr Richard Freeman was due to be a key witness for former GB cyclist Varnish as she attempts to sue British Cycling and UK Sport for wrongful dismissal. The 28-year-old is also claiming damages for sexual discrimination after she was dropped in 2016.
    
        
Varnish's lawyer David Reade QC said an ongoing General Medical Council probe into Freeman had caused his legal team to reconsider his attendance. The decision was announced to the tribunal in Manchester at the start of the afternoon session after doubts surfaced regarding Freeman's attendance in the morning.Reade said that Freeman's witness statement had been provided to GMC as part of their investigation and they were due to attend the tribunal because there was a chance his "probity could be cross-examined"."When we informed him of that, he was advised by his legal team that he should not give evidence," he said. Thomas Linden QC, representing British Cycling, said he did not accept that argument, stating that Freeman did not have "the courage to attend". Linden cited how in 2017 Freeman had failed to turn up to a parliamentary select committee after a "major depressive illness".Varnish tribunal day one: British Cycling coaches had 'extreme control'Varnish to call Freeman at tribunalHe also highlighted that the same year, Freeman was allowed to resign from British Cycling instead of face a disciplinary process for his poor record-keeping, as he was still suffering from depression and stress.But his health had appeared to have improved this year when he was well enough to promote his new book on sports medicine.Freeman became a controversial figure in British cycling because of his part in the jiffy-bag scandal. He denied any wrongdoing over a mystery medical package that was delivered to Sir Bradley Wiggins after a race in 2011, despite allegations of the misuse of an anti-inflammatory drug. Speaking at the release of his book earlier this year, he said the investigation into the jiffy-bag scandal had given him "suicidal thoughts". Linden added: "Freeman's credibility is an issue. He had form for pulling out."The hearing is expected to last until 17 December.
