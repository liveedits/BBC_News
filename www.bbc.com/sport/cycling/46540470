"We plan to be together in 2020 if at all possible."The British rider added: "We will all be doing everything we can to help make that happen - in different colours with a new partner, but with the same values, focus and desire to win."Sky to end backing in 2019Other riders on Team Sky's books include reigning Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas, Colombian prospect Egan Bernal, Dutchman Wout Poels, England's Ian Stannard and Wales' Luke Rowe.In an open letter to fans, the team admitted their future was in doubt."If we can find a new long-term partner to take the team forward into a new era, then we will do so," it read. "Equally, any future partner would have to be the right partner - one who shares our ethos and buys in to our values."Froome, whose contract with Team Sky runs until the end of the 2020 season, paid tribute to the team's current backers.When they were launched in 2010, Team Sky's ambition of delivering a first British Tour de France winner by 2015 was seen as ambitious.They achieved that goal three years ahead of schedule thanks to Sir Bradley Wiggins' 2012 success. Between him, Froome and Thomas, Team Sky have won the yellow jersey in six of the past seven races."Sky have been brilliant partners and it's been an incredible journey we have shared together," added Froome."I will always be grateful for their support."Everyone at Team Sky has got big ambitions for 2019 and this news has made us more more determined than ever to make them happen."'Let's build something new'Team principal Sir Dave Brailsford claimed Sky's withdrawal was "not really a surprise" and said he saw it as an opportunity."The reality of the situation with Sky is that change often leads to change," he told Sky Sports News."Nearly 10 years ago we started out with an ambition to win the Tour in the next five years - who would've thought that we would be here 10 years later?"You've got to be calm - in life the goalposts are going to move - it's not a question of if they move but when. We've reacted very calmly and change brings opportunities. We build things, we're creators and we see it as an opportunity.Brailsford added the team "couldn't be more grateful" to Sky and chief executive Jeremy Darroch for their backing."It's been an amazing run, but equally you look to the future and think, 'OK, let's move on, let's build something new'." 'Hopefully it's not the end'
                    
                        
                
                Geraint Thomas signed a new deal with Team Sky after winning his maiden Tour de France title this yearThomas confirmed the possibility of Sky ending their sponsorship was not raised during his contract renewal talks, with the Welshman having signed a new three-year deal in September.He said the news was a "shock" and "disappointing" but that he was "excited" for the future direction of the team."It's been an incredible nine years so far and we want to go out on a high and make 2019 the last and the best year yet," he said."We're still confident in Dave and the team that they can continue and keep the team together. "A lot of other teams have lost title sponsors but have continued - Movistar has been going for over 30 years with different sponsors."It's certainly not the end, or at least hopefully it's not the end, so it's also kind of exciting at the same time. It just gives everyone a bit more motivation to keep pushing on."
