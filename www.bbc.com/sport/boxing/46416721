But in the 12th he lay motionless after a savage combination, barely making the count to see out the contest, which was scored 115-111 for Wilder, 114-112 for Fury and 113-113.The challenger felt he had won and had he stayed on his feet in the final three minutes, the WBC title would have been his.After 36 minutes of the most tense and absorbing action, both men spoke of a rematch and such a date now appears a certainty.
