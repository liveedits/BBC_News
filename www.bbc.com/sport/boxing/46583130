The Briton was put down four times in three rounds by the talented Mexican, who took a version of the WBA world super-middleweight title."With my background and where I have come from, to get here and in with Canelo is an achievement," Fielding said after Saturday's bout in New York.
    
        
"He's the best I've fought - speed, power, footwork, defence, everything."The Liverpudlian added: "He does everything well. His timing is good, his selection is good and his presence - just being there making me work when I didn't have to."I knew I couldn't switch off and had to be on my game."Brilliant Taylor shines against WahlstromRelive Alvarez v Fielding and Taylor v Wahlstrom at MSGFielding, 31, said he regretted not using his height advantage of about six inches to keep the fight at distance.Instead, he allowed 28-year-old Alvarez to work in close and three of the four knockdowns before the third-round stoppage came after heavy shots to the body.Fielding said the body shots felt "like the wind was being taken out of me", adding: "He placed them well and caught me."I stood there too long, thought I could mix it with him and shouldn't have. With my height, I should have kept it long."I went in there, tried my best and that's what the elite are like. I never shied away from the challenge."I dared to be great, lived a dream - but I will come again and come back."The fight at Madison Square Garden was a first at 168lb for Alvarez, who also holds two world titles in the 160lb middleweight division.He is now tied to an 11-fight, five-year fight deal worth Â£278m but it is unknown if he will drop back down a division.Asked if Alvarez has the power to compete at the elite end of the super-middleweight division, Fielding said: "Definitely. He has that next-level power and puts shot together well."He can mix it with any super-middleweight."
