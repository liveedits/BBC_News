Alvarez now holds a minor version of the WBA world super-middleweight title.Brilliant Taylor shines against WahlstromRelive boxing from Madison Square Garden as Alvarez stops Fielding and Taylor outclasses WahlstromDespite the status of the WBA's 'regular' title compared to the 'super' title Britain's Callum Smith holds in the same division, Alvarez can now boast being a world champion in three weight divisions.He still holds the WBC and WBA titles at middleweight - a division lower - and his move up 8lb only ever looked like ending in victory as he broke Fielding's heart early on with a savage display of body punching."Fortunately for me he came to attack," said Alvarez. "That was the error he made and I did my thing in there."With the likes of Hollywood actor Bruce Willis, tennis legend John McEnroe and world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua ringside at Madison Square Garden, Alvarez quickly showed his intent by walking Fielding down to whip a left to the body which crumpled the Liverpudlian.Despite boasting about six inches in height advantage, Fielding at no point established range, allowing the onslaught to continue into round two when he again got back to his feet from an almost identical body shot.He fought back with combinations of his own in pockets but the shots carried minimal power with the fight being played out at Alvarez's range, ensuring he smothered and soaked up anything that came back his way.After a right which swept across Fielding's jaw to down him in three, the Briton was told "one more" from the official and it duly arrived, again a left to the body.More to follow.
