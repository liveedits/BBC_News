The 43-year-old will face either Tom Ford or Joe Perry in the last four.The world number three's path to Sunday's final opened up after the shock exits of world number five Judd Trump and China's number one Ding Junhui.Though he was irritated by moving photographers and spectators walking in and out of the arena - speaking to the referee on a number of occasions - he managed to maintain his composure against O'Donnell.A 102 looked to have set the tone against the world number 52, who beat Ding in the previous round, and although he was pegged back to 1-1, O'Sullivan took five frames in a row to advance comfortably to his 11th UK semi-final.In the evening session, Masters champion Mark Allen faces 2004 winner Stephen Maguire, while England's Stuart Bingham plays compatriot Kyren Wilson.
