Three-time winner John Higgins, Masters champion Mark Allen and 2015 world champion Stuart Bingham all went through safely.Scot Higgins saw off the unpredictable Thai talent Dechawat Poomjaeng 6-5, while Northern Ireland's Allen, who won the International Championship in China this month, beat Egypt's Basem Eltahhan 6-2.But there was no safe passage for Murphy, whose defeat against world number 124 Chen provided the biggest upset of the tournament so far. "I didn't see that coming. He played so well and deserved it," Murphy said."All was looking well at 3-1, but before I knew it I was staring defeat in the face."He potted some outrageous shots and I could do absolutely nothing about it.
