"I'd love to win more tournaments. I am trying to win this one but if I don't I am more than happy with my career."Chinese pair banned in snooker corruption scandalO'Sullivan: I'll quit snooker when I stop winningMark Selby's shock first-round exit in the tournament means 43-year-old Williams can reclaim the world number one ranking if he goes on to triumph in York - although he said he "does not want it".Williams has adopted a relaxed attitude since winning a thrilling third world title in Sheffield last May, saying he has practised very little in the past six months.Yet that lack of table time has not stopped the Welshman from claiming a 22nd ranking title - at the World Open in August - and in York Williams made Wells pay for errors, including in the third frame, when he cleared up with 67 after his opponent had made a break of 58."That is the best I have played since the World Open," said Williams. "I had two days' practice in the club before I came up here. I have probably been in the club 10 times since the World Championship."I am not bothered, I am still enjoying myself. I have not missed so many tournaments in my career. At the time I said I was going to enjoy winning the World Championship and I still am."I have had more holidays in the last year than in the last 20. Snooker is getting in the way. I am having the time of my life. This is my last tournament until the Masters - I am going on holiday."I am honest, I don't even want to be number one. If it comes, it comes. Selby can keep it."Williams faces either Thailand's Noppon Saengkham or Englishman Rod Lawler in the next round.
