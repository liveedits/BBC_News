While Selby struggled, fellow two-time UK winner and reigning world champion Mark Williams had little trouble in seeing off his amateur opponent, Adam Duffy.The 43-year-old Welshman, the winner of 22 ranking titles during his illustrious career, scored four half-centuries in a convincing 6-2? victory over world number.Williams, who has admitted he neglected his practice since winning the world title in May, showed few signs of rustiness."My performance was ok, but it was pretty scrappy stuff," he said."If I could win this tournament three times it would be fantastic. This will probably be my last tournament before Christmas so I want to try to have a good run and see what happens."     The second round of this year's tournament begins on Saturday, 1 December, when live coverage is available across the BBC on BBC Two, BBC iPlayer, the Red Button, Connected TVs and on the BBC Sport website and app. Sign up to My Sport to follow snooker news and reports on the BBC app.
