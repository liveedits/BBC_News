They are the first Chinese snooker players to be banned for cheating.Yu, who manipulated the outcome of five matches over a two-and-a-half year period, will serve the longest suspension since English player Stephen Lee was given a 12-year ban in 2013.The 31-year-old reached the semi-finals of the 2016 Scottish Open and was ranked 43 in the world when he was charged.Cao, 28 - who fixed three different matches - was runner-up in the Scottish event last year and world number 38 when initially suspended in May.More to follow.
