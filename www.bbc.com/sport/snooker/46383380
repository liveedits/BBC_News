They are the first Chinese snooker players to be banned for cheating.Yu, who manipulated the outcome of five matches over a two-and-a-half year period, will serve the longest suspension since English player Stephen Lee was given a 12-year ban in 2013.The 31-year-old reached the semi-finals of the 2016 Scottish Open and was ranked 43 in the world when he was charged.Cao, 28 - who fixed three different matches - was runner-up in the Scottish event last year and world number 38 when initially suspended in May.Both players were investigated by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) before an independent tribunal ruled on their cases.The tribunal, chaired by David Casement QC, found that Yu "engaged in deliberate and premeditated corruption to secure substantial financial gain for his friends/associates and himself."He also admitted lying to the investigator, failing to cooperate with the inquiry and betting on snooker when prohibited from doing so."It is very sad when talented players are attracted to the opportunity to make money from fixing matches," said WPBSA chairman Jason Ferguson.More to follow.
