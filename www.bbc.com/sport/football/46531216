Olivier Ntcham pulled a goal back at the death, scoring the rebound after missing a penalty, but it was Reginiussen's late strike for the section's bottom side that would prove pivotal.Celtic lost captain Mikael Lustig and Ryan Christie to injury as they chased the game against last year's semi-finalists. The Parkhead side finish their group campaign on nine points behind winners Salzburg, with the pair going into Monday's last 32 draw at midday GMT.Reaction & as it happened'A night of ice and fire' It was an evening that started with fire and ferocity outside Celtic Park on a frosty Glasgow night. Pyrotechnics and fireworks illuminated the sky in the east end of the city as a group of Celtic's supporters added to what they already knew was an occasion of great importance.However, that paled in comparison to the sparks that would fly in a spell-binding last 10 minutes at Celtic Park on what was a night of hard toil for the hosts. For all the illumination pre-match, the home side spent the majority of the game chasing shadows as they simply failed to get to grips with a Salzburg side that relentlessly forced them to retreat deep.Their cause was not helped as injuries took their toll. Firstly captain Lustig went off following a head knock, while man-of-the-moment Christie was stretchered off with his leg in a brace as a result of blocking a shot in the second half. He left the ground on crutches and concern will remain around how long it will be before he returns.The Austrians were dominant from the start. Fifteen minutes in came the first real warning shot as Diadie Samassekou's header came crashing back off the bar. 
                    
                        
                
                Celtic fans with pyrotechnics outside Celtic Park pre-matchAfter half an hour Kristoffer Ajer - who came on to replace Lustig - almost cost his team with an inexplicable pass straight to Hannes Wolf. He raced in on goal, only for Gordon to pull off a stunning save.The first half came and went without a shot on target for Rodgers' men, and the one-way traffic continued after the break despite Scott Brown's introduction for Scott Sinclair.For all Celtic's resolve before the break, the opener was just too easy for Salzburg. Stefan Lainer had the freedom of Glasgow to swing in a deep cross, with Dabbur splitting the centre-halves and heading in from six yards. Only a terrific save from Gordon would deny him a second four minutes later.However, there was no preparation for what was to come with 13 minutes to play as Celtic threatened to implode. With the ball in his grasp, Gordon attempted to throw it to Tierney, but only managed to crash it against the loitering Gulbrandsen. The Scotland goalkeeper attempted to recover, but it was too late.Celtic looked dead and buried and, when Ajer somehow turned the ball over the bar while just two yards from goal with eight minutes left, the writing was on the wall for the Scottish champions.But, with all hope lost, something extraordinary happened. With Celtic Park falling silent, a trickle of excitement, cheering and eventually euphoria began to bounce around the ground as word of Reginiussen's goal reached Glasgow.It seemed to rouse their team as Celtic began to drive forward and they got their reward when Filip Benkovic was upended in the box by Jerome Onguene. Ntcham's effort from the spot was knocked on to the post by Alexander Walke, only for the Frenchman to turn in the rebound. In the end, it didn't matter. Moments later a raucous roar erupted once more, heralding full-time in Leipzig. Celtic's early Christmas miracle had arrived.
                    
                        
                
                
            'A little bit of good fortune at the end' - analysisFormer Aberdeen defender Willie Miller on BBC ScotlandWe assumed that Salzburg had nothing to play for because they had won the group. We assumed Rosenborg had nothing to play for because they had no chance. And how wrong can you be on both counts. Celtic had to amass the points in the first place. But it was a little bit of good fortune in the end.It was better in the second half. Rodgers worked hard at half time, got the shape right and Celtic looked a much better force. But the first half was extremely disappointing. Celtic were all over the place. It could have been more embarrassing.Match statsCeltic's first attempt on target came in 89th minute from Olivier NtchamBrendan Rodgers' side have progressed through the group stages for just the second time (after 2014/15) having failed with their other three attemptsThey have failed to win any of their four European games against Red Bull Salzburg (D1 L3)Celtic won three of their six games - as many as they have managed in their previous 18 Europa League gamesFC Red Bull Salzburg have won 37 Europa League games since it was rebranded in 2009-10 - more than any other teamNo player has scored more Europa League goals this season than Salzburg's Munas Dabbur (6)Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsCeltic1Gordon23LustigSubstituted forAjerat 21'minutes5Simunovic32BenkovicBooked at 88mins63Tierney49Forrest42McGregor18Rogic11SinclairSubstituted forBrownat 45'minutes17ChristieSubstituted forNtchamat 58'minutes22EdouardSubstitutes3Izaguirre8Brown15Hayes16Morgan21Ntcham29Bain35AjerRB Salzburg33Walke22Lainer15RamalhoBooked at 87mins6OnguénéBooked at 19mins17Ulmer8Samassekou45MwepuSubstituted forLeitgebat 80'minutes16Junuzovic18MinaminoSubstituted forGulbrandsenat 74'minutes9DabburSubstituted forPrevljakat 90+1'minutes13WolfSubstitutes1Stankovic11Prevljak20Daka21Gulbrandsen24Leitgeb34Pongracic55TodorovicReferee:Ruddy BuquetMatch StatsHome TeamCelticAway TeamRB SalzburgPossessionHome48%Away52%ShotsHome11Away18Shots on TargetHome4Away6CornersHome4Away11FoulsHome4Away11Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Celtic 1, FC Red Bull Salzburg 2.Full TimePosted at 90'+8' Second Half ends, Celtic 1, FC Red Bull Salzburg 2.Posted at 90'+7' Corner,  FC Red Bull Salzburg.
