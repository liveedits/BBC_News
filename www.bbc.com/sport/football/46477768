But the on-loan Leicester forward again turned provider for the winner, with a clever backheel that left-back Gibbs drilled in from 10 yards to finish a fine move involving Matty Phillips.Victory moves West Brom above Sheffield United up to third and stretches their unbeaten run to six games, while the Blades have failed to win any of their past three league games at home.Relive West Brom's win at Bramall LaneIt was a first league win for the Baggies at Bramall Lane since February 2004, when their current boss Darren Moore scored at both ends in a 2-1 victory.West Brom also registered three successive away victories for the first time since winning four in a row on their way to the Championship title in 2008.Barry, 37, showed all his experience with a left-footed drive into the top corner from the edge of the penalty box for his first of the campaign.Gibbs added to earlier goals this season against QPR and Millwall as he ensured Sheffield United's wait for a first home league win since the end of October went on.West Bromwich Albion head coach Darren Moore told BBC WM:"Once 20-25 minutes went by, we started to grow into the game and got a foothold, more so in the second half when I thought we dominated the ball."It was a good night's football and a good away performance."It's a difficult place to come, they ask a lot of questions of you and they're a good team. We had to be at our best in spells and it proved that tonight."Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsSheff Utd1Henderson6Basham12EganBooked at 62mins5O'Connell2Baldock16Norwood4FleckSubstituted forCouttsat 58'minutes3StevensSubstituted forJohnsonat 90'minutes21DuffySubstituted forWashingtonat 77'minutes17McGoldrick10SharpSubstitutes15Coutts19Stearman22Johnson25Moore27Smith28Cranie39WashingtonWest Brom1Johnstone24Adarabioyo25Dawson26Hegazi3Gibbs10Phillips8Livermore18Barry15BarnesSubstituted forBruntat 90+3'minutes19Rodriguez16GayleSubstitutes6Sako11Brunt12Mears13Myhill14Townsend17Burke34HarperReferee:Jeremy SimpsonAttendance:23,400Match StatsHome TeamSheff UtdAway TeamWest BromPossessionHome49%Away51%ShotsHome10Away14Shots on TargetHome3Away5CornersHome5Away5FoulsHome7Away12Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Sheffield United 1, West Bromwich Albion 2.Full TimePosted at 90'+5' Second Half ends, Sheffield United 1, West Bromwich Albion 2.Posted at 90'+3' Corner,  West Bromwich Albion.
