According to reports in Argentina, Boca players suffered cuts from the glass from broken windows and were also affected by the tear gas used by police.A number of players, including Boca's former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez, were reportedly suffering from dizziness and vomiting and being treated by club doctors.Footage apparently from inside the Boca dressing room showed the players groggy and disorientated.Reports said Boca's Pablo Perez and Gonzalo Lamardo had been taken by ambulance to hospital, the former with slivers of broken glass in his eyes and the latter a cut on his head.
