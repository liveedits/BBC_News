Yet Spurs, against the run of play, were ahead before the break. Eric Dier glanced home Christian Eriksen's free-kick to equalise, sparking a melee involving players from both sides with his celebrations in front of Arsenal's fans, before Harry Kane scored from the spot after Rob Holding was penalised for a challenge on Son Heung-min.Emery introduced Alexandre Lacazette and Aaron Ramsey at the start of the second half to dramatic effect. The Welshman set up Aubameyang's magnificent finish and the France striker's deflected shot beat goalkeeper Hugo Lloris from the edge of the area to put Arsenal ahead with 16 minutes left.The outstanding Lucas Torreira ran clear to wrap up Arsenal's win and Spurs' misery was complete when Vertonghen was sent off for a foul on Lacazette.Follow all the reaction from Emirates StadiumMore to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsArsenal19Leno20MustafiBooked at 37minsSubstituted forGuendouziat 71'minutes5Papastathopoulos16Holding2Bellerín11TorreiraBooked at 78mins34XhakaBooked at 49mins31Kolasinac7MkhitaryanSubstituted forRamseyat 45'minutes14Aubameyang17IwobiSubstituted forLacazetteat 45'minutesSubstitutes1Cech4Elneny8Ramsey9Lacazette12Lichtsteiner15Maitland-Niles29GuendouziTottenham1Lloris24AurierBooked at 90mins21Foyth5VertonghenBooked at 85mins33DaviesSubstituted forRoseat 82'minutes15DierBooked at 32mins17Sissoko23Eriksen20AlliBooked at 65minsSubstituted forWinksat 79'minutes10Kane7Son Heung-MinSubstituted forLucas Mouraat 79'minutesSubstitutes3Rose4Alderweireld8Winks16Walker-Peters18Llorente22Gazzaniga27Lucas MouraReferee:Mike DeanMatch StatsHome TeamArsenalAway TeamTottenhamPossessionHome59%Away41%ShotsHome22Away11Shots on TargetHome7Away6CornersHome8Away5FoulsHome15Away17Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Arsenal 4, Tottenham Hotspur 2.Full TimePosted at 90'+7' Second Half ends, Arsenal 4, Tottenham Hotspur 2.Posted at 90'+6' Attempt blocked.
