And they responded brilliantly to get the win their performance deserved and secure qualification for the next stage of the tournament.Substitute Jesse Lingard scored from almost on the line with 12 minutes left before, with five minutes remaining, captain Harry Kane slid in Ben Chilwell's free-kick to send England through and relegate Croatia.Passion?

                Croatia win perfect end to 2018 - KaneSouthgate will have feared an old flaw was returning to haunt his side when Kramaric put Croatia ahead just before the hour after seemingly taking an age to twist and turn before beating Jordan Pickford.It was cruel on England and punishment for failing, as they did in Moscow, to make the most of vast first-half superiority as they created a series of chances but contrived to miss them, with Kane and Raheem Sterling the chief culprits.England could have been forgiven for believing the fates were against them as they trailed to their League A Group Four opponents, who have become something of a bogey side over the years.Instead, they responded with courage and character as the clock ticked down to rescue glory and a place in Portugal from the prospect of relegation into the lower reaches of the Nations League. The victory also guarantees England a place in the Euro 2020 play-offs, a fallback in the event they fail to qualify for that tournament through the traditional route.Southgate can take his share of the credit for two attacking substitutions, sending on Lingard and Jadon Sancho with England's backs against the wall, the reward coming in the shape of that decisive late rally.It hardly counts as retribution for the disappointment of the World Cup semi-final but it was a demonstration this England side is developing under Southgate, this victory acting as a measure of their progress.How the players ratedWhat's at stake in final week of group games?England embrace the Uefa Nations League
                    
                        
                
                England defenders Kyle Walker (left in top photo) and Joe Gomez after Croatia's goal and then at the end of the matchThe obvious joy of England's players and supporters after that dramatic finale was another indicator the Uefa Nations League, mocked and maligned at its inception, is capturing the public's imagination.It is not yet close to being ready to be spoken about in the same breath as the major tournaments such as the World Cup and the Euros - but England's adventure so far has produced hard evidence the idea behind its creation - to add an extra edge beyond traditional friendlies - has been a success.The atmosphere inside Wembley when England went a goal behind was testament to this, with the crowd clearly aware of the consequences and what Southgate's men required to avoid the worst fate.The group situation added an extra layer of tension and atmosphere, contributing to a memorable conclusion.The Nations League results have also seen England respond to an ongoing criticism they fail to beat the top sides, with even Southgate insisting they could not be considered among the world's elite until they beat the best. The World Cup did nothing to answer those questions.Now, in this increasingly competitive environment, they have recorded significant wins away to Spain and now at home to the team that outmanoeuvred them in Moscow.England and Wembley embraced this new format - and relished in the occasion.Music to Croatia's ears?England's 'Football Coming Home' anthem became a serious bone of contention at the World Cup - with Croatia using it as a sign of arrogance from their opponents in the build-up to the semi-final.That was harsh and misleading as the song was actually written as a hymn to England's failures and disappointments in the lead-up to staging Euro '96 on home soil.In Russia, it worked to fire up Croatia even if it was unfair on England as the message was twisted.Was it mischievous, then, that the strains of the song were belted out over Wembley's public address system at deafening volume the second the final whistle sounded and was instantly joined by thousands of celebrating England fans?No-one should count this as revenge for the World Cup but England and their supporters took great satisfaction in overcoming notoriously difficult opponents.Man of the match - Joe Gomez (England)
                    
                        
                
                
            Kane ends barren run - the statsEngland have won four of their past five matches (D1), having won just one of their six before that (D1 L4).This was Croatia's first defeat against England since September 2009, when they lost 5-1 in a World Cup qualifier at Wembley.Kane ended a run of 747 minutes without an England goal, scoring his first since his penalty against Colombia at the World Cup. This was his 20th England goal.Lingard's goal for England was their first goal via a throw-in since May 2014 (Daniel Sturridge v Peru).Kramaric scored with Croatia's first shot on target of the match.Lingard has scored as many goals in his past two England matches (two) as he managed in his first 20 caps for the Three Lions.England have won 15 of their past 16 competitive matches at Wembley (L1).This was England's 17th game in 2018 - their joint-most matches in a calendar year, also playing 17 times in 1966.What they said?England manager Gareth Southgate on BBC Radio 5 live: "I think the most pleasing thing of the year has been the connection with the fans and being able to share brilliant experiences with them."Today was brilliant - I can't remember the new Wembley like that. We have exciting players that give them excitement."We were by far the better team in the first half and we came back from a soft goal. If you're going to win a game that's the way you want to win."We were playing against a very, very good side. To keep the ball, use the ball and create chances was very pleasing. And you have to keep calm - when you think the chances have gone then you have to keep believing."England striker Harry Kane on BBC Radio 5 live, talking about where his winning goal ranks: "It's right up there. To see the fans like they were and the belief they showed. It's all about having match-winners in the squad."It's one of England's best years. We could win a trophy."To carry the momentum into the new year... we've had a fantastic year, but not rested on our laurels."England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford on BBC Radio 5 live: "The atmosphere is probably the best we've had at Wembley, so credit to the fans."This Nations League makes you want to beat the best. We've beaten two of the top 10 sides in the world. Now we have another semi-final - it'll be a good summer."Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsEngland1Pickford2Walker5Gomez6Stones3Chilwell7BarkleyBooked at 26minsSubstituted forAlliat 63'minutes4Dier8DelphSubstituted forLingardat 73'minutes10Sterling9Kane11RashfordSubstituted forSanchoat 73'minutesSubstitutes12Alexander-Arnold13Butland14Lingard15Dunk16Keane17Sancho18Shaw19Winks20Alli21McCarthy22Loftus-Cheek23WilsonCroatia12L Kalinic2VrsaljkoSubstituted forMilicat 26'minutes6LovrenBooked at 89mins21Vida16JedvajBooked at 67mins10Modric11BrozovicBooked at 67mins9Kramaric8VlasicSubstituted forRogat 79'minutes4Perisic18RebicSubstituted forBrekaloat 45'minutesSubstitutes1Livakovic3Milic5Mitrovic7Brekalo13Caleta-Car14Bradaric15Pasalic17Rog19Badelj20Pjaca22Pivaric23LeticaReferee:Anastasios SidiropoulosAttendance:78,221Match StatsHome TeamEnglandAway TeamCroatiaPossessionHome62%Away38%ShotsHome17Away12Shots on TargetHome8Away3CornersHome9Away4FoulsHome9Away11Live TextPosted at   Match ends, England 2, Croatia 1.Full TimePosted at 90'+4' Second Half ends, England 2, Croatia 1.Posted at 90'+3' Foul by Jadon Sancho (England).Posted at 90'+3' Domagoj Vida (Croatia) wins a free kick in the defensive half.Posted at 90'+1' Attempt blocked.
