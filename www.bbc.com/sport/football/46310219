"I am very happy to extend my time at Liverpool. It is a great day for me and I have made the best decision in my career," he said.Talks over the new deal, which is believed to run until 2023, were opened at the end of last season but have only been finalised now."I am looking forward to everything - to helping the team, to helping the club achieve our dreams and, especially, to win trophies," he added."I've always said, when I knew I had a chance to come here I didn't have to think twice. The right club in the right moment and with the right coach as well. I came here and was very happy."Liverpool throw-in coach Gronnemark extends contract with clubMane was voted the club's Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year in his debut season and then scored 10 of his 20 goals last season in the Champions League as Liverpool reached the final.He went on to play for Senegal at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, scoring once in three outings.He was recently named on the 30-man shortlist for the 2018 Ballon d'Or and is among the five contenders for this year's BBC African Footballer of the Year."I can't think of a single club anywhere in Europe that wouldn't want a player like Sadio available to them, so the fact he wants to remain with us says something about where we are currently," said Reds boss Klopp."He is a such an important member of our team and squad. He radiates joy and I think this is reflected in his performances and impact on the pitch."The only criticism I could ever have of Sadio is that maybe at times he is the only one not to see just how good he is - but as an attacking player he is the complete package."Maybe the other thing which is lost on some who don't know Sadio is just how ambitious and hungry he is to achieve things and be successful. He is more driven than I think many will be aware of."Mane's deal follows similar long-term commitments by Mane's fellow forwards Roberto Firmino, who agreed his deal in April, and Mo Salah, who signed a new contract in July.
