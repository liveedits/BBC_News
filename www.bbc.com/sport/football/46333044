Following Scott Arfield's red card for a rash challenge on goalkeeper Zdenek Zlamal, the visitors held on for the final 20 minutes to move a point clear.Hearts were rewarded for a strong start by a Gareth McAuley own goal but Connor Goldson quickly levelled.
    
        
Alfredo Morelos then added the decisive touch from an offside position.The striker's goal, equalling the Premiership era record of scoring in seven successive games, was one of many contentious moments in a tempestuous game.It was a fourth league loss in a row for Hearts, who were top of the table in early November, leaving them in fourth place.Gerrard hails 'big win' as Rangers go topIt was like playing 12 men, fumes Hearts boss LeveinHearts 1-2 Rangers - as it happenedThe hosts were much improved from their limp loss at St Mirren and headers from Steven MacLean and Arnaud Djoum forced good early saves from Allan McGregor.A neat move on 29 minutes culminated with Marcus Godinho delivering a low cross from the right and a sliding McAuley could only divert the ball into his own net.Rangers responded with a ferocious onslaught, with Djoum diving to nod clear from a Ovie Ejaria header, moments before the leveller arrived.Zlamal saved well at the feet of Goldson from a corner but the central defender was able to bundle the rebound high into the net.A James Tavernier free-kick brushed the side-netting and Zlamal blocked bravely from McAuley as Rangers kept up the pressure and what proved to be the winner arrived before the interval.Morelos, who missed a good chance on the volley before Hearts scored, raced away too early from a free-kick and was clearly offside when he applied a deft touch to Tavernier's terrific delivery. But the goal stood and took the Colombian's tally for the season to 17.Morelos was involved in a running battle with returning Hearts captain Christophe Berra all afternoon, with both men frequently wrestling off the ball.The frantic pace continued in the second half, with both sets of players, both dugouts and the fans inside a packed stadium screaming for every decision.Goalmouth chances dried up though, as Rangers took a hold of midfield and looked menacing on the counter-attack.Morelos went close, stretching to send Ejaria's cross just wide before Rangers picked up their seventh red card of the season.Zlamal produced two good stops to deny Daniel Candeias and Morelos, and had the ball in both hands on the goalline as Arfield came clattering in to ram it over the line, smashing into the keeper's head with his knee.Referee Bobby Madden, who had produced just one yellow card in a stormy contest, immediately sent Arfield packing but Gerrard's depleted side had few problems holding out.
                    
                        
                
                Scott Arfield was sent off for a late, sliding challenge on goalkeeper Zdenek Zlamal'Rangers hit back quickly and decisively' - AnalysisBBC Scotland's Brian McLauchlin at TynecastleCredit must go to Gerrard and his players. They fought back quickly and decisively and deserved their victory. They also had more than a slice of fortune for what proved to be the winner. Morelos escaped punishment after jumping into Hearts captain Berra and was then one of three Rangers men in an offside position when he flicked the ball into the far corner.There is no doubting the talents of Morelos but not for the first time his temperament can be called into question. And Gerrard will surely be asking questions of Arfield, who needlessly went in with both feet on Zlamal giving the referee no option but to issue a straight red card.Rangers now sit proudly at the top of the top flight for the first time in seven years. The task that lies ahead is to stay there and keep Celtic, who have played a game fewer, at bay.For Hearts this was their sixth match without a win in all competitions but it was a spirited performance and, with the busy December period now under way, may not have to wait too long before they get back to winning ways.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsHearts1Zlamal26GodinhoSubstituted forDikamonaat 64'minutes2Smith6Berra11Mitchell9ClareSubstituted forMorrisonat 77'minutes20CochraneSubstituted forLeeat 70'minutes7Bozanic5Haring10Sutchuin-Djoum18MacLeanSubstitutes8Lee13Doyle15Wighton16Hughes23Mulraney28Dikamona38MorrisonRangers1McGregor2Tavernier6Goldson36McAuley16Halliday10Ejaria23CoulibalySubstituted forMcCrorieat 81'minutes37ArfieldBooked at 72mins21CandeiasSubstituted forLaffertyat 86'minutes20Morelos35GrezdaBooked at 63minsSubstituted forJackat 64'minutesSubstitutes3Worrall8Jack11Lafferty13Foderingham15Flanagan17McCrorie40MiddletonReferee:Bobby MaddenAttendance:19,429Match StatsHome TeamHeartsAway TeamRangersPossessionHome45%Away55%ShotsHome5Away17Shots on TargetHome2Away8CornersHome5Away10FoulsHome17Away12Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Heart of Midlothian 1, Rangers 2.Full TimePosted at 90'+6' Second Half ends, Heart of Midlothian 1, Rangers 2.Posted at 90'+4' Alfredo Morelos (Rangers) wins a free kick in the defensive half.Posted at 90'+4' Foul by Clévid Dikamona (Heart of Midlothian).Posted at 90'+2' Ovie Ejaria (Rangers) wins a free kick on the right wing.Posted at 90'+2' Foul by Djoum (Heart of Midlothian).Posted at 89' Andy Halliday (Rangers) wins a free kick in the attacking half.Posted at 89' Foul by Steven MacLean (Heart of Midlothian).Posted at 88' Attempt missed.
