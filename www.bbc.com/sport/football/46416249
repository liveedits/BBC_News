Lucy Staniforth's free-kick smacked the bar with the Blues' closest effort.The presence of England boss Phil Neville for two of the WSL's high-fliers highlighted the quality of the two sides, as did the four and three-match winning runs the respective sides brought into the game.Birmingham's defensive record has been their strength, with just eight league goals conceded this season, and it took a goalkeeping slip-up from the inexperienced Hampton, just 18-years-old, to hand City a route to goal.That said, it was the only mistake of an otherwise composed display as City were frustrated in their bid for a second goal.Blues boss Marc Skinner, who became a father in midweek, saw his side hold possession well but did not get into the final third enough, with England international Staniforth creating their best moments.However, Man City were more threatening and, having gained the early lead, were able to contain Birmingham to maintain their unbeaten WSL record in this campaign.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsMan City Women26Roebuck23McManus6Houghton5Beattie3Stokes8Scott24WalshBooked at 17mins25WullaertSubstituted forBeckieat 79'minutes12StanwayBooked at 90mins19WeirSubstituted forEmslieat 60'minutes17ParrisSubstituted forBonnerat 90+3'minutesSubstitutes1Bardsley4Bonner9Bremer11Beckie14Morgan16Park22EmslieB'ham City Women29Hampton23Scott25Mannion3Sargeant6Harrop7Arthur4LaddSubstituted forScofieldat 87'minutes11Quinn37Staniforth14FollisSubstituted forMaylingat 74'minutes15WellingsSubstitutes2Williams8Mayling18Scofield21Hayles30BergerAttendance:1,157Match StatsHome TeamMan City WomenAway TeamB'ham City WomenPossessionHome47%Away53%ShotsHome8Away14Shots on TargetHome4Away4CornersHome5Away5FoulsHome19Away3Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Manchester City Women 1, Birmingham City Women 0.Full TimePosted at 90'+6' Second Half ends, Manchester City Women 1, Birmingham City Women 0.Posted at 90'+4' Corner,  Manchester City Women.
