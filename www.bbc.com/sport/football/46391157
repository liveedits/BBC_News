"Macclesfield fans will probably say 'what's going on here?'" he said when asked if his appointment was a gamble."You've got an international footballer who has been one of the best footballers in the world coming to your club, I think there's a nice mutual balance there."As a player, Campbell won two Premier League titles and two FA Cups with Arsenal and was named in the 2002 World Cup all-star team after helping England to the quarter-finals of the tournament.He begins his managerial career four years after describing the lack of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) managers in English football as a "sad indictment" of the game.Campbell's appointment makes him the eighth BAME manager in England's top four divisions, while he also spent time coaching with England's Under-21 side earlier this month as part of a Football Association initiative to address the issue of under-representation of BAME coaches.Asked if he could see improvements being made, he said: "I'm not going to go down that road and state the obvious."I've got the opportunity and I've got to take it with both hands, work my socks off and see how far I can go."That's the thing for me. You want the situation to become normal, so you don't see black or white, you just see a football manager."More to follow.
