Beth Mead, Lia Walti and Miedema all went close after the break before Mead curled in the fourth late on.The Gunners made an excellent start - Miedema forced a great save from Marie Hourihan while Van de Donk hit the post. Umotong's first-ever WSL goal was almost followed by a second for Brighton, but Victoria Williams could not connect properly with a volley.From there Arsenal began to dominate - Katie McCabe and Miedema going close before they equalised. It came moments after Kayleigh Green had seen her long-range shot touched onto the Arsenal crossbar.The Gunners raced down the other end and capitalised on confusion in the Brighton defence that allowed Miedema the chance to round goalkeeper Hourihan for her 14th league goal of the season.Within minutes they were ahead as Bloodworth converted from close range with Miedema turning provider with the cutback. Van de Donk headed in the third from a corner before the game dropped in pace after the interval.Arsenal continued to threaten, but it took until the final 10 minutes before they broke through again as Mead's right-footed effort from the left corner of the box evaded Hourihan.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsArsenal Women1van Veenendaal17Evans6Williamson16Quinn3MitchellSubstituted forGayleat 81'minutes7van de DonkSubstituted forKuykenat 81'minutes20Bloodworth19Wälti15McCabe11MiedemaSubstituted forGrantat 88'minutes23MeadSubstitutes18Peyraud-Magnin24Kuyken27Grant28GayleBrighton Women1Hourihan8Barton6Rafferty20Williams17Perry12Peplow15GreenSubstituted forBrettat 86'minutes10Natkiel14LeggSubstituted forBrazilat 45'minutes9Umotong7WhelanSubstitutes3Gibbons13Gillett16Brazil18Brett19Harris21Simpkins23Le TissierMatch StatsHome TeamArsenal WomenAway TeamBrighton WomenPossessionHome65%Away35%ShotsHome24Away4Shots on TargetHome10Away1CornersHome11Away1FoulsHome7Away12Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Arsenal Women 4, Brighton and Hove Albion Women 1.Full TimePosted at 90'+2' Second Half ends, Arsenal Women 4, Brighton and Hove Albion Women 1.Posted at 90'+1' Corner,  Arsenal Women.
