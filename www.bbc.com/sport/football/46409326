Chelsea gained confidence and momentum and improved after the break, securing the win with 12 minutes left when David Luiz's glancing header following a corner bounced in off the far post.They closed out the win to give Sarri his first triumph over Pep Guardiola and leave Liverpool top by one point following their convincing 4-0 win at Bournemouth earlier.City pay for lacking killer touchCity's multi-talented squad can cover almost all eventualities, but this was a game in which they sorely missed the marksmanship of the injured Sergio Aguero, and also Kevin de Bruyne's creation.Guardiola's side were on another level to Chelsea for the first 44 minutes but when chances presented themselves, as they did to both Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane, there was either hesitation or an inability to provide the final product that proved crucial.This is not a criticism of either Sterling or Sane but there was a lingering feeling that had the same opportunities to the predatory Aguero, the outcome would have been different.City could not recover from Kante's sucker punch and it was Chelsea who were the more dangerous side in the second half.Guardiola's men must now regroup after a defeat that will be a major disappointment but one hardly likely to set City back for too long.Kante proves Sarri's pointKante's outstanding performance, including the opening goal, was vindication for Sarri's decision to play him in a new role this season.Sarri has been questioned for his decision to use Jorginho as the hub of his team while pushing Kante into a more advanced role out on the right. Why have the player many regard as the finest holding midfield player in world football and not utilise him there?Sarri has stuck to his guns and this was a game - and performance by Kante - that added significant weight to his argument.The France World Cup winner was magnificent, typically tireless but also getting into forward positions, most decisively when he arrived on the end of Hazard's inviting pass to power a finish past Ederson that gave the Brazilian no chance.It is certainly not the end of the argument, but evidence Sarri can use that he is coming up with the right formula for Chelsea.This was a vital, some might say unexpected, win for Chelsea given their indifferent recent form, and they certainly lived on their nerves for the first 44 minutes as City's passing and mobility pulled them all over Stamford Bridge.Man of the match - N'Golo Kante
                    
                        
                
                N'Golo Kante's goal was vital, but that was only a small part part of his excellent performanceFortress Stamford Bridge - the statsChelsea are unbeaten in 12 Premier League games at Stamford Bridge (W7 D5), their longest run without a home league defeat since a 21-game streak ending in August 2015.City suffered their first Premier League defeat in 22 games, since a 3-2 loss to Manchester United in April. They also conceded more than one goal in a Premier League game for the first time in 22 matches in the competition, since that derby defeat.This was Sarri's first victory over Guardiola, ending a run of three defeats against the Spaniard in all competitions (W1 L3).Guardiola has lost three leagues games against Chelsea, more than against any other side as a manager.Kante's opening goal came from Chelsea's first shot of the match in the 45th minute, the longest they have had to wait for a shot in a league game at Stamford Bridge since 2006-07.With four goal involvements in the Premier League this season in 16 games (2 goals, 2 assists), Kante has already equalled his combined goal and assist tallies from his previous two top-flight seasons with Chelsea (2 goals, 2 assists in 69 games).Hazard has provided an assist in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since December 2014.Hazard has now assisted a league-high eight goals in the Premier League this season, which is double the tally he assisted in 34 apps last season (4).What next?Both teams play in Europe in midweek, completing groups from which they have already qualified. City host Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Wednesday and Chelsea have a Europa League trip to Vidi on Thursday.In the Premier League, City's home game against Everton is next Saturday's 12:30 GMT kick-off, while Chelsea travel to Everton at 13:30 on Sunday.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsChelsea1Arrizabalaga28Azpilicueta2Rüdiger30David Luiz3Alonso7Kanté5JorginhoBooked at 63mins17KovacicSubstituted forBarkleyat 65'minutes11PedroBooked at 80mins10E HazardSubstituted forGiroudat 90'minutes22WillianSubstituted forLoftus-Cheekat 75'minutesSubstitutes4Fàbregas8Barkley12Loftus-Cheek13Caballero18Giroud27Christensen33EmersonMan City31Ederson2Walker5Stones14Laporte18Delph20Bernardo Silva25Fernandinho21SilvaSubstituted forGündoganat 68'minutes26MahrezSubstituted forFodenat 84'minutes7Sterling19SanéSubstituted forGabriel Jesusat 53'minutesSubstitutes3Danilo4Kompany8Gündogan30Otamendi33Gabriel Jesus47Foden49MuricReferee:Michael OliverAttendance:40,571Match StatsHome TeamChelseaAway TeamMan CityPossessionHome39%Away61%ShotsHome8Away14Shots on TargetHome5Away4CornersHome1Away13FoulsHome12Away11Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Chelsea 2, Manchester City 0.Full TimePosted at 90'+5' Second Half ends, Chelsea 2, Manchester City 0.Posted at 90'+4' Attempt missed.
