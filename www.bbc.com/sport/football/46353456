City controlled the game with more than 70% of possession but Abdoulaye Doucoure scrambled in for Watford in the 85th minute to give the hosts hope of an unlikely comeback.That resulted in a nervy finish for City as the hosts sent Foster forward for set-pieces, with Guardiola introducing defensive reinforcements to deal with the pressure, but the visitors held on for their seventh successive league win.The victory moves them five points clear of second-placed Liverpool, who will again try to reduce the gap when they travel to Burnley on Wednesday.Reaction to Tuesday night's Premier League actionSquad depth helps City rumble onThe trip to Vicarage Road was City's second of 13 matches in 44 days and manager Pep Guardiola once again rotated his squad, as he did in the weekend win over Bournemouth.Sergio Aguero remained sidelined with injury, top scorer Raheem Sterling was rested and an entirely different back four was brought in, including captain Vincent Kompany and England defenders Kyle Walker and John Stones.Mahrez and David Silva were two of those rested at the weekend and both returned and were influential throughout.City would have added more goals but for the excellence of Foster, who denied Mahrez and Sane when one-on-one in the first half.He also produced a fine low save to stop the Algerian's 20-yard shot in the second.The edgy finish to the game was in stark contrast to the rest of the match when City looked in control.The Watford goal came just two minutes after Kompany left the field holding his hamstring, something which will be of concern with the number of games to come in the coming weeks, and suddenly City's defence looked flustered.Regardless City held on for their 13th win from 15 games this season and remain unbeaten.Watford show promiseDefeat for Watford sees them remain in their slump following an impressive start to the season. They have won just two of their last 11 games, after winning their first four this season.It is the first time they have lost three consecutive games under Javi Gracia and they now have their lowest points total after 15 games in their four seasons since returning to the top flight.However there is no greater challenge currently than facing Guardiola's City and there were positives for Watford.They had few chances but, at 0-0, City goalkeeper Ederson saved well with his legs from Troy Deeney and they did manage to worry their opponents in the closing stages.Foster was excellent in goal and while City dominated possession, Watford did not allow themselves to be cut apart and managed to stay in the game.More to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsWatford26Foster21Femenía27Kabasele15Cathcart25Holebas14ChalobahSubstituted forDeulofeuat 63'minutes10SuccessSubstituted forGrayat 75'minutes19HughesSubstituted forQuinaat 52'minutes16Doucouré37Pereyra9DeeneySubstitutes1Gomes6Mariappa7Deulofeu11Masina18Gray20Quina24WilmotMan City31EdersonBooked at 90mins2Walker5Stones4KompanySubstituted forOtamendiat 83'minutes18Delph20Bernardo Silva25Fernandinho21SilvaSubstituted forGündoganat 73'minutes26Mahrez33Gabriel JesusSubstituted forLaporteat 89'minutes19SanéSubstitutes3Danilo7Sterling8Gündogan14Laporte30Otamendi47Foden49MuricReferee:Paul TierneyAttendance:20,389Match StatsHome TeamWatfordAway TeamMan CityPossessionHome30%Away70%ShotsHome11Away15Shots on TargetHome7Away7CornersHome3Away11FoulsHome4Away8Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Watford 1, Manchester City 2.Full TimePosted at 90'+5' Second Half ends, Watford 1, Manchester City 2.Posted at 90'+3' Offside, Watford.
