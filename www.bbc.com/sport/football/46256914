And while Sam Vokes responded for the home side - connecting with Mee's long ball to loop a header over goalkeeper Martin Dubravka from almost 18 yards - they were unable to force an equaliser.In truth that would have been harsh on Newcastle who were superior for long periods and could have added to their tally through Matt Ritchie and substitute Joselu, who struck the post.The result leaves Burnley 17th in the table, one point above the relegation zone.More to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsBurnley20Hart2Lowton28Long6Mee3Taylor25Lennon16DefourSubstituted forHendrickat 82'minutes4Cork12BradySubstituted forBarnesat 83'minutes9Vokes11WoodSubstitutes1Heaton10Barnes13Hendrick14Gibson18Westwood26Bardsley27VydraNewcastle12Dubravka22Yedlin5Schär18Fernandez2Clark11RitchieBooked at 90mins15KenedySubstituted forHaydenat 90'minutes10Diamé4Ki Sung-yueng17Pérez9RondónSubstituted forJoseluat 71'minutesSubstitutes7Murphy8Shelvey14Hayden19Manquillo21Joselu30Atsu41WoodmanReferee:Anthony TaylorAttendance:20,628Match StatsHome TeamBurnleyAway TeamNewcastlePossessionHome56%Away44%ShotsHome14Away17Shots on TargetHome4Away3CornersHome5Away5FoulsHome6Away11Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Burnley 1, Newcastle United 2.Full TimePosted at 90'+5' Second Half ends, Burnley 1, Newcastle United 2.Posted at 90'+5' Attempt missed.
