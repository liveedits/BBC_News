And while Sam Vokes responded for the home side - connecting with Mee's long ball to loop a header over goalkeeper Martin Dubravka from almost 18 yards - they were unable to force an equaliser.In truth that would have been harsh on Newcastle who were superior for long periods and could have added to their tally through Matt Ritchie and substitute Joselu, who struck the post.The result leaves Burnley 17th in the table, one point above the relegation zone.Burnley's defensive woe continuesWhile Burnley began the encounter having scored the same number of goals (12) as at this stage last term, their travails have emanated from the other end of the pitch. Their success in finishing seventh in the Premier League in May was largely constructed on their solid defence - those foundations have crumbled in a start littered with a series of individual and collective errors.Both of Newcastle's first-half goals were symptomatic of those problems. Mee's own-goal came after Clarets forward Chris Wood made a dreadful attempt to clear a corner under little pressure, and it was compounded when the defender diverted a shot past Joe Hart that appeared to be drifting wide.  Newcastle's second was another gift, with Burnley initially failing to react at a corner and then allowing Ciaran Clark a free header from eight yards. Clark's effort delivered an unwanted 27th goal against Sean Dyche's side, who reached the 31 March during the 2017-18 season before conceding that number.And things might have been worse for the hosts but Magpies wing-back Matt Ritchie somehow contrived to miss from two yards out in the second period after another defensive error. Burnley also appear to be suffering from another problem, with former England defender Danny Mills indentifying the predictable nature of their attacking play as a further area of concern."I'm a massive fan of Sean Dyche, but you can't keep playing like that - pumping long balls up to two big lads up front," Mills told BBC Radio 5 live."They need something different. They'll score the odd goal like that but not two or three and then you're not going to dominate sides, so you'll always be under pressure. They need to change the way they play."Newcastle finding their feet After an abject start, taking three points from a possible 30 in a winless ten-game run, Benitez's team have at last found their feet. Newcastle had lost each of their last 10 Premier League games played on a Monday night before this trip to Lancashire.  But if the omens were not in their favour, their performance on Monday night was suggestive of a team growing in confidence.That was buoyed by gaining a two-goal advantage within 25 minutes and Benitez's tactics, which included the deployment of a trio of central midfielders, enabled them to control the game. There were also solid performances from Fernandez and Fabian Schar at the heart of a reinforced rearguard.The Argentina and Switzerland defenders both arrived in a summer when a lack of investment in the transfer market led to supporter protests. But unity appears to have temporarily been restored and both played their part in this success, making 10 clearances each, alongside Clark, who made 11.
