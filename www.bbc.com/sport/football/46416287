Jota had given Wolves the lead before the break when he side-footed home.
    
        
Ayoze Perez's superb header quickly pulled Newcastle level, but they were reduced to 10 men when DeAndre Yedlin was sent off after 57 minutes.Newcastle had dominated the first half - Salomon Rondon smashing a free-kick against the crossbar with one of their 10 shots - but came under increasing pressure after Yedlin's dismissal. Doherty forced a diving save from Dubravka and Raul Jimenez hit the crossbar, before the former struck the decisive blow as the clock ticked down.Victory is Wolves' second in succession in the Premier League - the first time they have secured back-to-back wins since early October.Persistence pays off as Jota impresses
                    
                        
                
                Jota has scored in back-to-back Premier League games, after not scoring in his first 13Wolves' week could not have gone much better.This victory came four days after they ended a run of seven league games without a victory by beating fourth-placed Chelsea 2-1.They were made to work hard by Newcastle, who had the upper hand prior to Yedlin's dismissal.But Jota was again influential - scoring his second goal in as many weeks and winning the free-kick which led to the sending-off. It was also his shot that was palmed into Doherty's path late on, and Wolves will hope his bright form continues throughout a festive period that includes matches against Liverpool and Tottenham.For now, though, they can celebrate a place in the Premier League's top 10.More to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsNewcastle12Dubravka6Lascelles18FernandezSubstituted forManquilloat 45'minutes2ClarkBooked at 90mins22YedlinBooked at 57mins10Diamé4Ki Sung-yuengBooked at 18mins30AtsuSubstituted forKenedyat 89'minutes11Ritchie17Pérez9RondónSubstituted forJoseluat 86'minutesSubstitutes3Dummett13Muto15Kenedy19Manquillo21Joselu36Longstaff41WoodmanWolves11Rui Patrício5BennettBooked at 80mins16CoadyBooked at 72mins15Boly2DohertyBooked at 33mins27SaïssSubstituted forJiménezat 60'minutes8Neves29Vinagre10Hélder CostaBooked at 65minsSubstituted forJoão Moutinhoat 76'minutes37TraoréSubstituted forGibbs-Whiteat 60'minutes18JotaBooked at 73minsSubstitutes7Cavaleiro9Jiménez17Gibbs-White21Ruddy28João Moutinho32Dendoncker33BonatiniReferee:Mike DeanAttendance:50,223Match StatsHome TeamNewcastleAway TeamWolvesPossessionHome51%Away49%ShotsHome12Away13Shots on TargetHome4Away6CornersHome4Away6FoulsHome10Away17Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Newcastle United 1, Wolverhampton Wanderers 2.Full TimePosted at 90'+7' Second Half ends, Newcastle United 1, Wolverhampton Wanderers 2.BookingPosted at 90'+6' Ciaran Clark (Newcastle United) is shown the yellow card.Posted at 90'+6' Raúl Jiménez (Wolverhampton Wanderers) wins a free kick in the attacking half.Posted at 90'+6' Foul by Ciaran Clark (Newcastle United).Goal!Posted at 90'+4' Goal!
