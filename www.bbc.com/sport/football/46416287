Jota had given Wolves the lead before the break when he side-footed home.
    
        
Ayoze Perez's superb header quickly pulled Newcastle level, but they were reduced to 10 men when DeAndre Yedlin was sent off after 57 minutes.Newcastle had dominated the first half - Salomon Rondon smashing a free-kick against the crossbar - but came under increasing pressure after Yedlin's dismissal. Doherty forced a diving save from Dubravka and Raul Jimenez hit the crossbar, before the former struck the decisive blow as the clock ticked down.Victory is Wolves' second in succession in the Premier League - the first time they have secured back-to-back wins since early October.Persistence pays off as Jota impresses
                    
                        
                
                Jota has scored in back-to-back Premier League games, after not scoring in his first 13Wolves' week could not have gone much better.This victory came four days after they ended a run of seven league games without a victory by beating fourth-placed Chelsea 2-1.They were made to work hard by Newcastle, who had the upper hand prior to Yedlin's dismissal.But Jota was again influential - scoring his second goal in as many weeks and winning the free-kick which led to the sending-off. It was also his shot that was palmed into Doherty's path late on, and Wolves will hope his bright form continues throughout a festive period that includes matches against Liverpool and Tottenham.For now, though, they can celebrate a place in the Premier League's top 10.Frustration for gutsy NewcastleNewcastle have now failed to win their past three Premier League games, but could easily have taken all three points against Wolves.They were on the front foot from the start - Rondon forcing a save from Rui Patricio with a fizzing half-volley moments after kick-off.As well as having 60% of the possession in the first half, the Magpies had 10 shots, four on target - a tally they have only bettered once this season.But the game changed when Yedlin was sent off. His tackle on Jota was clearly a foul but, with Jamaal Lascelles well placed to cover, the Magpies will question whether a yellow card would have sufficed.It was the first of two questionable decisions, the second when Wolves defender Willy Boly appeared to elbow Perez as he jumped for a header.Ultimately it was a frustrating evening for Newcastle, who have now lost seven of their nine home games this season.
