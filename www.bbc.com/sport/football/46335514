If we do really well and get to the [Euro 2020] final and we win it, [you will say] they will want me to say. Well there might be a push for me to stay."There might also be a job in the Premier League as well and I might want to move on. And if we do badly and we don't qualify, then you won't want me here anymore. So it kind of works for me."Stephen Kenny: From Dundalk to future Republic of Ireland bossKenny, who has stepped down from his role as manager of the League of Ireland champions, is not scheduled to speak to the media until Monday.The Republic job became vacant after Martin O'Neill's departure on Wednesday.McCarthy's last job saw him leaving Championship club Ipswich Town in April while Kenny steps down from Dundalk after guiding the club to four of the last five League of Ireland titles.
