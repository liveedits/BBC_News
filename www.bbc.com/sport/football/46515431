"The abuse he received, particularly in the media beyond that tournament, I've not seen it before," said Neville.Neville, working on the England coaching staff at the time, recalled Sterling visiting him a few days before England's last-16 defeat by Iceland at the Euros in France two years ago."Pre-tournament he was getting battered, so much stick," the ex-Manchester United defender said on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football."We were aware of that and it continued into the tournament and to the stadiums - there were boos and groans."It takes a lot for a player to see a coach, he walked in and started to download on me. 'Why is this happening? Why is this bring accepted?' "He accepted he'd be criticised as a player but felt it was so vicious he didn't know what to do about it."Sterling received heavy criticism for his performances at Euro 2016, in a tournament that ended in the embarrassment of defeat to minnows Iceland and manager Roy Hodgson losing his job.He was among England players booed off at half-time during a group match against Wales - and was substituted at the interval - and signed off an Instagram message following the team's exit with #TheHatedOne.There were reports of concerns for Sterling from within the England camp at the time, and Neville says "there was a tonal difference to the attacks he was getting" during the tournament."As a coach - being honest - I didn't know how to deal with it," he said. "I went into protection mode, coach mode - 'Raheem you're a great player and we love you to bits'."I tried to patch him up, but you were never dealing with the underlying issue and maybe you couldn't. Maybe I brushed it aside a little bit."He was willing to stand up and play but he's been carrying this for years. I've known about this for years and was it happening before that even? To perform the way he has done is a miracle almost."Racism 'blatant' in coverageSterling has frequently found himself at the centre of the media's attention throughout his career, most recently for a tattoo of a rifle on his leg earlier this year.He later defended the tattoo, saying it had a "deeper meaning" and referred to his late father, who was killed in Kingston, Jamaica.That followed criticism for proposing to his girlfriend, purchasing clothes at high-street chain Primark and for buying his mother a house.In his social post on Saturday, Sterling cited newspaper headlines about Manchester City team-mates Tosin Adarabioyo and Phil Foden buying houses.The headline referring to 21-year-old defender Adarabioyo - who is on loan at West Brom - focuses on how he spent £2.25m on a property "despite having never started a Premier League match".By contrast, midfielder Foden, 18, "buys a £2m home for his mum" and is later described as having "set up a future".The Professional Footballers' Association has said negative press coverage of Sterling "emboldens racist rhetoric".And Neville argued coverage of Sterling has more than "undertones" of racism - "it's blatant," he said."I can imagine that when he was writing that message he'd have thought long and hard about what that brings him. It started a debate. What happens beyond today and this message?"There's been times where we've avoided taking on this subject but Raheem has forced it to be taken on."He was strong enough to come out of it, his mentality is incredible. He had is best ever season last year."Empowering other people to come out and us having the debate - it's good we're talking about it."'Perception Sterling is more interested in cars and night clubs is garbage'Jamie Carragher, also speaking on Sky Sports, played with Sterling at Liverpool, and believes the player's decision to join Manchester City for £44m in 2015 has created an unfair perception of his character."The perception is of a young, flash, black kid from London. A lot of it comes from maybe moving from Liverpool - the perception that he's more interested in cars, jewellery, night clubs than football," said Carragher."Anyone writing that - it's garbage. Raheem was a mouse, he wasn't on nights out, he was humble and trained very well. "He's never been able to shake off that tag of being more interested in money and flashness. He might buy a ring or something for his mother and that's always the story. I think it has racial undertones."
