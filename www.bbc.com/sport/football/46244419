Patrick van Aanholt twice went close, Andros Townsend blazed wide while a header by Cheikhou Kouyate was also disallowed for offside.Reaction to all of Saturday's Premier League gamesRelive the action from Old TraffordThis is United's worst start to a season in 28 years.Where is United's season heading?Fans have had to endure some disappointments this season, and this was another day at the office to forget for Jose Mourinho and his players.Palace had lost on their past 11 league visits to Old Trafford and arrived at the venue flirting with relegation after seven top-flight matches without a win.On the eve of the game, Mourinho had claimed United could break into the Premier League's top four by the end of December.They still might, but they will have to play an awful lot better than they did in this laboured performance, which left them 14 points behind leaders Manchester City.Paul Pogba and Lukaku were recalled to the side, yet World Cup winner Pogba failed to finish the game and Lukaku is still searching for his first league goal since 15 September as United failed to score at home for the fourth time this campaign. Lingard was United's most threatening player for spells and his first-time shot from close range brought out the very best from Hennessey.Anthony Martial rarely looked like making it six goals in six Premier League games as United dropped two more points ahead of a congested eight-match December programme, which includes games against Arsenal (home) and Liverpool (away).Palace show they have the stomach for a fightThe long wait for a Palace league victory at Old Trafford goes on.Yet Roy Hodgson and his players left Manchester with renewed vigour in their battle to stay out of the relegation zone.The odds were stacked against Palace here. They have suffered 17 defeats in their past 20 league visits to Old Trafford and have not scored a league goal at the ground since 2004.However, Wilfried Zaha sparkled on his return to his former club as Hodgson's team produced one of their best performances of the season to secure a crucial point.Zaha's pace caused countless problems, and if Townsend had shown more composure after creating an opening for himself in the second half, Palace would have been celebrating a famous win.They are one point above the relegation zone with a tough December, including a visit to leaders Manchester City and a home game with Chelsea, on the horizon.This gritty performance will at least give them some encouragement.Man of the match - Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace)
                    
                        
                
                Zaha's pace caused problems throughout and the former Manchester United player had four shots - more than than any of his team-matesWhy there was at least one positive for Man Utd - the statsThis was United's first home Premier League clean sheet of the season - they last kept one against Watford in May. Palace had 13 shots in this match, their most in an away Premier League game this season. However, just two were on target.United are unbeaten in their last 21 league meetings with Crystal Palace (W17 D4).Palace picked up a first point in a league game at Old Trafford since winning 2-1 in December 1989.This was United's 65th 0-0 draw in the 26 seasons of the Premier League - 31% of them have come in the six seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson retired.United failed to score in a top-flight home meeting with Crystal Palace for the first time since October 1970.What's next?Manchester United at back at Old Trafford on Tuesday when they look to book a place in the Champions League knockout stage with one Group H game to spare. That will happen if they defeat Young Boys (20:00 GMT) and Juventus beat Valencia on the same night.Meanwhile, Crystal Palace have a week to prepare for the visit of fellow strugglers Burnley to Selhurst Park on 1 December (15:00).Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsMan Utd1De Gea36Darmian12Smalling2Lindelöf18YoungBooked at 71mins14LingardSubstituted forFellainiat 60'minutes31Matic6PogbaSubstituted forSánchezat 68'minutes8MataSubstituted forRashfordat 60'minutes9Lukaku11MartialSubstitutes4Jones7Sánchez10Rashford13Grant17Fred25A Valencia27FellainiCrystal Palace13Hennessey29Wan-Bissaka5Tomkins12SakhoBooked at 27mins3van Aanholt18McArthur8Kouyaté4MilivojevicBooked at 9mins7Meyer10TownsendSubstituted forSchluppat 88'minutes11ZahaSubstituted forJ Ayewat 90+1'minutesSubstitutes2Ward9Sørloth14J Ayew15Schlupp31Guaita34Kelly42PuncheonReferee:Lee MasonAttendance:74,516Match StatsHome TeamMan UtdAway TeamCrystal PalacePossessionHome60%Away40%ShotsHome12Away13Shots on TargetHome5Away2CornersHome10Away3FoulsHome13Away12Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Manchester United 0, Crystal Palace 0.Full TimePosted at 90'+5' Second Half ends, Manchester United 0, Crystal Palace 0.Posted at 90'+5' Foul by Alexis Sánchez (Manchester United).Posted at 90'+5' Luka Milivojevic (Crystal Palace) wins a free kick in the attacking half.Posted at 90'+4' Alexis Sánchez (Manchester United) wins a free kick in the defensive half.Posted at 90'+4' Foul by James McArthur (Crystal Palace).Posted at 90'+3' Attempt missed.
