Villa then took the lead for the first time when Anwar El Ghazi curled in, but Grabban's near-post finish earned Forest a remarkable late point.Relive Wednesday's EFL actionAt the end of a breathless encounter, the two sides remained three points apart in the Championship table, with eighth-placed Villa still unbeaten at home since Dean Smith's arrival on 10 October.For 21-year-old Chelsea loanee Abraham, who has now scored six goals in his past three games, his hat-trick - which came in the space of 25 first-half minutes - was his first in senior football.Before that, Forest had started brilliantly, with two goals in the opening six minutes, as Grabban tapped home and Carvalho slotted in from Lolley's good ball.Then Abraham netted twice in three minutes to quickly make it 2-2, heading home his first before the second hit him on its way in.Cash then raced through an out-of-sorts Villa defence to make it 3-2 but Abraham hit back from the spot after Yannick Bolasie was brought down by Jack Robinson.After Lolley's strike, Figueiredo was dismissed for a bad foul on John McGinn - with Abraham's fourth and then El Ghazi giving Villa the lead for the first time in the match with 15 minutes to play, But Grabban's equaliser moved Forest up to sixth in the table, as Derby dropped out of the play-off places as they lost at Stoke.Goals, goals, goalsVilla have now scored 12 times in three matches, after Sunday's lively 4-2 win over local rivals Birmingham City followed their impressive 3-0 win at Derby.But conceding goals had not previously been something visitors Forest were known for - Aitor Karanka's men arrived at Villa Park on a run of three consecutive clean sheets.Yet the Reds, who led three times in the game, missed the chance to move within three points of the automatic promotion places.Villa, whose confidence levels appear to have soared since Smith's arrival from Brentford, have taken 13 points from a possible 21 since he took charge.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsAston Villa1Nyland21HuttonBooked at 69mins4Tuanzebe5Chester3Taylor7McGinnSubstituted forWhelanat 79'minutes14Hourihane10Grealish11BolasieBooked at 20minsSubstituted forEl Mohamadyat 83'minutes18Abraham26KodjiaSubstituted forEl Ghaziat 66'minutesBooked at 87minsSubstitutes6Whelan9Hogan22El Ghazi27El Mohamady31Bunn34Doyle-Hayes36O'HareNottm Forest1Pantilimon27DarikwaBooked at 69mins20Dawson3Pereira FigueiredoBooked at 68mins18Robinson6ColbackBooked at 78mins24YacobBooked at 65mins23Lolley10Antunes CarvalhoSubstituted forHefeleat 70'minutes14CashSubstituted forBastião Diasat 77'minutes7GrabbanSubstituted forAnsarifardat 90+1'minutesSubstitutes5Guédioura11Osborn15Steele21Janko31Bastião Dias37Ansarifard44HefeleReferee:Simon HooperAttendance:32,868Match StatsHome TeamAston VillaAway TeamNottm ForestPossessionHome63%Away37%ShotsHome26Away8Shots on TargetHome12Away5CornersHome12Away2FoulsHome9Away18Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Aston Villa 5, Nottingham Forest 5.Full TimePosted at 90'+6' Second Half ends, Aston Villa 5, Nottingham Forest 5.Posted at 90'+5' Attempt blocked.
