Villa then took the lead for the first time when Anwar El Ghazi curled in, but Grabban's near-post finish earned Forest a remarkable late point as they scored from all five of their efforts on target.Incredibly, the hosts had the ball in the net twice more in the closing stages, but first El Ghazi was adjudged to have used his hand and then Abraham's stoppage-time effort was ruled out for offside.It would have meant an improbable fifth goal of the game for the 21-year-old Chelsea loanee, who had already registered his first hat-trick in senior football and reached double figures for the season after only 14 appearances.Relive Wednesday's EFL actionHow the mayhem unfolded
                    
                        
                
                Ten goals, two disallowed goals, one red card and a first career hat-trick...Forest squandered leads on three occasions, while Villa only led once in the entire match - yet still the teams could not be separated after 90 minutes.

"But when you're on the pitch it's just end-to-end and you have to keep getting ready for a chance."Villa boss Smith pointed out that his side had 26 attempts on goal compared to eight for the visitors, adding that keeper Orjan Nyland was not at his busiest."I don't think our goalkeeper's made a save," he said. "We're devastated by the fifth goal because that's something we should've better at."Forest manager Karanka told BBC Radio Nottingham: "I think it's been a crazy game but we can't forget we've played against one of the best teams, with better players, and we were attacking even with 10 men."A crazy night at Villa Park in pictures
