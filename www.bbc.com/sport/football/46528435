Hoffenheim's wall reacts to Leroy Sane's (left) fierce free-kick which resulted in City's equaliserLeroy Sane scored twice as Manchester City came from a goal down to beat Hoffenheim and finish as Champions League Group F winners.City created most of the several clear-cut chances in an entertaining encounter, but they only came to life after Hoffenheim took the lead through Andrej Kramaric's 16th-minute penalty.Gabriel Jesus and Nicolas Otamendi hit the post with headers for the home side, while John Stones had one brilliantly saved by the well-worked Oliver Baumann.
    
        
The equaliser came when Sane fired in a fierce 25-yard free-kick in first-half stoppage time. His second of the game - and eighth of the season - came just after the hour mark when he finished off a swift counter-attack.City are the only one of the four qualified English teams to win their group, and as a result can only draw one of four teams in the last 16 - Atletico Madrid, Schalke, Roma or Ajax.Follow Wednesday's Champions League actionEarly jolt for CityAny hopes City had of an easy ride against opponents with faint hopes of a Europa League spot were extinguished early.The three-man defence was put on the backfoot with former Leicester forward Kramaric leading the early assaults. He first tested the City goal with a rising drive before an exquisite effort on target was thwarted by the athleticism of Ederson.City rode their luck for 16 minutes until Aymeric Laporte pushed over defender Benjamin Hubner six yards from goal, and conceded a penalty. Kramaric stepped up to slot in his ninth goal in nine games for club and country.However, that strike had an undesired effect for Hoffenheim as City's attack moved up the gears.Super Sane leads fightbackThe German side were under incessant pressure for the rest of the game and Jesus, Otamendi and Stones had gone close before Sane equalised with a breathtaking strike.They should have added to the lead after the break when Raheem Sterling broke clear from the edge of the area with Sane and Bernardo Silva in support. The England winger passed to Sane, who instead of shooting elected to play the ball square to Silva - his shot was easily blocked by Baumann.Manager Pep Guardiola looked on in disbelief along with the supporters inside the Etihad Stadium. However, Sane made amends moments later when, following another break, he took the ball past Baumann and slotted in.More to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsMan City31Ederson5StonesSubstituted forWalkerat 45'minutes30Otamendi14Laporte35ZinchenkoSubstituted forDelphat 64'minutes20Bernardo SilvaSubstituted forKompanyat 85'minutes8Gündogan47Foden7Sterling33Gabriel Jesus19SanéSubstitutes2Walker4Kompany18Delph26Mahrez49Muric55Diaz61NmechaHoffenheim1Baumann3Kaderábek15Adams Nuhu21Hübner16Schulz8GeigerSubstituted forAmiriat 63'minutes11GrillitschBooked at 64mins13BittencourtSubstituted forBelfodilat 70'minutes2BrenetSubstituted forNelsonat 45'minutes27Kramaric34Apolinário de LiraBooked at 77minsSubstitutes4Bicakcic9Nelson17Zuber18Amiri19Belfodil32Grifo36KobelReferee:Andreas EkbergMatch StatsHome TeamMan CityAway TeamHoffenheimPossessionHome62%Away38%ShotsHome22Away14Shots on TargetHome8Away5CornersHome8Away6FoulsHome11Away14Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Manchester City 2, TSG 1899 Hoffenheim 1.Full TimePosted at 90'+3' Second Half ends, Manchester City 2, TSG 1899 Hoffenheim 1.Posted at 90'+3' Corner,  TSG 1899 Hoffenheim.
