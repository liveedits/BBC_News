"The information is, things are better than last time," said Mourinho."We are staying at a hotel a few metres away. If it is not better I walk [to Old Trafford]."Are Man Utd feeling the pressure at home?As well as issues getting to Champions League matches at Old Trafford, United have had mixed fortunes on the field at home, losing three times in all competitions. But Mourinho dismissed any suggestion that his players cannot cope with the pressure of home advantage.  "If you feel pressure stay at home and watch it on TV," he added. "If you feel pressure to play at home where people come to support, come on. I never feel pressure at home. If you ask me if I prefer to go back to Bern or play at home, I will always say I prefer to play at home."What I want is a team to start strong, not to be waiting, not to be reactive. "Probably you thought Jose told them to start slow, to play nice and easy and see what happens or to be losing. It is exactly the opposite. I want them to start strong and go for it almost immediately."Lindelof suffers 'proper injury'Mourinho confirmed that Sweden international Victor Lindelof is expected to be out for some time after picking up a "proper injury" against Crystal Palace on Saturday.Eric Bailly and Luke Shaw are set to return to his squad though.

United are now clear favourites to go through to the last 16 with Juventus. "Manchester United were 1-0 down in Italy with five minutes remaining but scored two late goals. This has given them a 93% chance of progress according to the Euro Club Index Link whereas United's chance would have been closer to 50/50 had they lost."
