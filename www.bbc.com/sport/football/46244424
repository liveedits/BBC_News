Sane added a fine third from Sterling's volleyed cross, with the German's touch leaving defender Fabian Balbuena on the ground, allowing him to slot home.West Ham were much better in the second half and Michail Antonio hit the post - but Sane scored his second and City's fourth in injury time.Manuel Pellegrini's Hammers side, who saw Marko Arnautovic hobble off late on, have now won only once in seven games.Relive the action as it happenedFollow reaction from every Premier League gameCity cruise at London Stadium againThe Premier League champions - who remain two points clear of Liverpool at the top of the table - have now played four games at West Ham's new stadium, scoring four or five in each one.They were stylish and clinical in the first half and efficient after the break.Some of City's football in the opening 35 minutes was what we have come to expect from Pep Guardiola's side. Sterling and Sane in particular were brilliant as they dominated possession with plenty of crisp passing.Silva scored their opener from close range, although Sterling will not be credited with the assist as his cross took a slight deflection.The two wide men combined for the second goal as Sane shimmied past Pablo Zabaleta and gifted Sterling a simple goal.Sterling then set up Sane, who showed wonderful composure to turn round a defender and guide a shot into the net.City are the only team not to drop a point from a winning position in the Premier League this season, so a comeback was never on the cards.They only had nine shots in total and they looked comfortable, but not spectacular, in the second half.In truth, Sane's injury-time fourth - from substitute Gabriel Jesus' cross - was harsh on West Ham.Arnautovic injury a worry for HammersWest Ham were thrashed once again by City, and have won only once since 29 September, but they perhaps deserved better than a 4-0 defeat in the end.They were outclassed in the first half - although they made it easy for City - but they improved after bringing on the lively Aaron Cresswell at the break.Antonio was unlucky to hit the outside of the post as he ran onto Javier Hernandez's raking through ball.Arnautovic and Balbuena headed efforts over the bar as their chances for a consolation came and went.Arnautovic was hurt by a fair Nicolas Otamendi tackle and tried to play on after treatment - but did limp off late on with all of West Ham's substitutions already used.The Austria international is the club's top scorer this season with five goals.Man of the match - Leroy Sane (Man City)
