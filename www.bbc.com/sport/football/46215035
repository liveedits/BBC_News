Rooney will also get a guard of honour.The former Manchester United and Everton striker initially ended his international career with 119 caps and a record 53 goals.But the Football Association see Thursday's match against the US as an opportunity to "honour" his "record-breaking international career".Manchester City's Delph said: "When I first came into the England set-up, Wayne was captain. He welcomed me and put his arm around and made me feel at home. "As soon as he comes on, I will give him the armband back."We are going to be giving him a guard of honour. It is going to be a huge night for Wayne and it is important we honour him for all of his achievements."Manager Gareth Southgate added: "I don't want to pin an exact time on when Wayne comes on because you don't know how the flow if the game will go."We will give him enough so that it is fitting but we also want to make sure we get the balance of looking at younger players and making sure our preparation for Sunday is another priority."It's important for all of us as a group that he gets a good send-off."More to follow.
