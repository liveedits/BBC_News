                Rooney and FA felt farewell game was 'right'Rooney will leave the squad before they face Croatia in the Nations League at Wembley on Sunday.Manchester City player Delph said: "When I first came into the England set-up, Wayne was captain. He welcomed me and put his arm around and made me feel at home."As soon as he comes on, I will give him the armband back."It is going to be a huge night for Wayne and it is important we honour him for all of his achievements."Manager Gareth Southgate added: "I don't want to pin an exact time on when Wayne comes on because you don't know how the flow if the game will go."We will give him enough so that it is fitting but we also want to make sure we get the balance of looking at younger players and making sure our preparation for Sunday is another priority."It's important for all of us as a group that he gets a good send-off."'Disappointing to see Rooney have to defend inclusion'Rooney's inclusion was criticised by England's record appearance-maker Peter Shilton, who said caps should not be "given out like gifts".Former goalkeeper Shilton, who made 125 international appearances, said he was "surprised" Southgate had allowed the one-off return.Rooney said he would not have agreed to play had it impacted the legacy of others, such as by "taking the record off Shilton".Southgate, who won 57 caps, said: "It's been disappointing to see him have to defend his inclusion."He is very different to run-of-the-mill players like me who played for England. I spoke to the under-15s last week and they are so early in their development but he was around the senior squad when he was 17."I know a big regret for him was that the team didn't get to where he wanted but when you look at the pressure he had to deal with individually, it is an incredible career."Hopefully he has felt that warmth from all of us and I know the reaction of the supporters will be very special to him."
