Hammers goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski had saved a first-half penalty from Joe Ralls with the score 0-0.Perez scored his first league goal in 700 days following some sloppy defending from Cardiff and a clever chip by Snodgrass, and added a second when played in on the left-hand side of the penalty area by Arthur Masuaku.West Ham moved up to 12th in the table, while Neil Warnock's Cardiff have taken only one point from seven away games this season and sit two points above the relegation zone.Hammers on the riseWest Ham dominated throughout, with Cardiff keeper Neil Etheridge denying Angelo Ogbonna, Declan Rice and Arnautovic in the first half-hour.Aside from Ralls' penalty, Fabianski was rarely tested, while the hosts continued to pepper Cardiff's goal as Rice, Ogbonna and Grady Diangana went close.Cardiff's 95th-minute goal came when Fabianski flapped at a corner and his defenders failed to clear.
                    
                        
                
                Josh Murphy's goal in the 95th minute was the last touch of the matchWest Ham, who recorded consecutive league wins for the first time since January 2017, face five more teams in the bottom half of the table in December.Their sole defeat in six league games came against reigning champions Manchester City in November.The only negative in another dominant Hammers performance was Arnautovic's hamstring injury.Cardiff's away blues go onWith only three goals, Cardiff have the joint-worst record in the league away from home - equal with bottom-of-the-table Fulham, and West Ham enjoyed 76% of possession in the first 20 minutes.Arnautovic's nudge on Junior Hoilett gave Cardiff an opportunity to take the lead against the run of play, but Ralls' poor penalty was saved by Fabianski diving to his left.Perez's two goals early in the second half effectively settled the contest, and Antonio nodded in at the near post from Robert Snodgrass' corner to underline West Ham's superiority.With three more away games this month and a home match against Manchester United, Cardiff face the prospect falling into the relegation zone before New Year.Man of the match - Lucas Perez
                    
                        
                
                Perez had played no more than 27 minutes in a league game before to his introduction against Cardiff but he was sharp when taking his chances and deserved his two goalsA rock in the net - the best of the statsCardiff had only one shot on target in the second half.Lucas Perez scored his first Premier League goals since January 2017 and became the first West Ham player to score twice as a substitute in a Premier League match since Paulo Wanchope against Newcastle in April 2000.West Ham keeper Lukasz Fabianski has saved the past three penalties he has faced in the Premier League, having saved only two of his previous 19.Robert Snodgrass provided two Premier League assists in a game for the first time since December 2012 (for Norwich against Swansea).62% of Michail Antonio's Premier League goals have been headers (13 of 21). Of players to have scored at least 20 goals in the competition, only Sami Hyypia (77%), Sol Campbell (75%) and John Terry (66%) have scored a higher ratio with their head.What's next?West Ham host Crystal Palace on Saturday at 15:00 GMT), when Cardiff welcome fellow strugglers Southampton.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsWest Ham1Fabianski30Antonio23Diop21Ogbonna26Masuaku11SnodgrassSubstituted forDianganaat 76'minutes16Noble41Rice8Felipe Anderson17HernándezSubstituted forCarrollat 64'minutes7ArnautovicBooked at 36minsSubstituted forPérezat 40'minutesSubstitutes4Balbuena5Zabaleta9Carroll13Adrián14Obiang27Pérez45DianganaCardiff1Etheridge5Ecuele Manga4Morrison22BambaBooked at 65mins3Bennett17Gunnarsson21Camarasa8RallsBooked at 40minsSubstituted forMendez-Laingat 64'minutes7Arter33HoilettSubstituted forMurphyat 64'minutes13PatersonSubstituted forK Harrisat 73'minutesSubstitutes2Peltier11Murphy12Smithies14Reid19Mendez-Laing23K Harris24MadineReferee:Graham ScottAttendance:56,811Match StatsHome TeamWest HamAway TeamCardiffPossessionHome61%Away39%ShotsHome17Away9Shots on TargetHome11Away5CornersHome10Away4FoulsHome10Away10Live TextPosted at   Match ends, West Ham United 3, Cardiff City 1.Full TimePosted at 90'+6' Second Half ends, West Ham United 3, Cardiff City 1.Goal!Posted at 90'+5' Goal!
