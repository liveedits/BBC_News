West Ham goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski had saved a first-half penalty from Joe Ralls.Perez scored his first league goal in 700 days following some sloppy defending from Cardiff and a clever chip by Snodgrass, and added a second when played in on the left-hand side of the penalty area by Arthur Masuaku.West Ham moved up to 12th in the table, while Neil Warnock's Cardiff have taken only one point from seven away games this season and sit two points above the relegation zone.Hammers on the riseWest Ham dominated throughout, with Cardiff keeper Neil Etheridge denying Angelo Ogbonna, Declan Rice and Arnautovic in the first half-hour.Aside from Ralls' penalty, Fabianski was rarely tested, while the hosts had continued to pepper Cardiff's goal as Rice, Ogbonna and Grady Diangana all went close.Cardiff's stoppage-time goal came when Fabianski flapped at a corner and his defenders failed to clear before Murphy bundled the ball over the line.West Ham, who recorded consecutive league wins for the first time since January 2017, face five more teams in the bottom half of the table in December.Their only defeat in six league games came against reigning champions Manchester City in November.The only negative to another dominant Hammers performance was Arnautovic's hamstring injury.More to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsWest Ham1Fabianski30Antonio23Diop21Ogbonna26Masuaku11SnodgrassSubstituted forDianganaat 76'minutes16Noble41Rice8Felipe Anderson17HernándezSubstituted forCarrollat 64'minutes7ArnautovicBooked at 36minsSubstituted forPérezat 40'minutesSubstitutes4Balbuena5Zabaleta9Carroll13Adrián14Obiang27Pérez45DianganaCardiff1Etheridge5Ecuele Manga4Morrison22BambaBooked at 65mins3Bennett17Gunnarsson21Camarasa8RallsBooked at 40minsSubstituted forMendez-Laingat 64'minutes7Arter33HoilettSubstituted forMurphyat 64'minutes13PatersonSubstituted forK Harrisat 73'minutesSubstitutes2Peltier11Murphy12Smithies14Reid19Mendez-Laing23K Harris24MadineReferee:Graham ScottAttendance:56,811Match StatsHome TeamWest HamAway TeamCardiffPossessionHome61%Away39%ShotsHome17Away9Shots on TargetHome11Away5CornersHome10Away4FoulsHome10Away10Live TextPosted at   Match ends, West Ham United 3, Cardiff City 1.Full TimePosted at 90'+6' Second Half ends, West Ham United 3, Cardiff City 1.Goal!Posted at 90'+5' Goal!
