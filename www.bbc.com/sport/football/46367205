Johnston skidded a late shot past Craig Gordon to earn an unlikely draw.Champions Celtic now trail Kilmarnock by a point - with two games and hand - and trail Rangers by goal difference. On Saturday, Celtic host Kilmarnock, whose manager Steve Clarke has yet to lose to the Parkhead side in his spell at Rugby Park.Motherwell, whose best chance before the goal was a Conor Sammon shot straight at Gordon, stay ninth - six points clear of the relegation play-off place.Reaction & as it happenedChristie class amid chaosMost of the discussion pre-match was on who had been left out of the Celtic team. From Sunday's League Cup final win there were seven changes in total, including Odsonne Edouard, Tom Rogic and James Forrest all dropping out, with captain Scott Brown among those returning.However, it did not take long into proceedings at a misty Fir Park for the headlines to turn to one man who is simply undroppable. Sitting narrow on the left of the Celtic midfield, Christie was unplayable at times, particularly early on as Motherwell, who lost captain Peter Hartley after six minutes to injury, were pushed deeper and deeper.On 13 minutes, the man who won Rodgers his seventh trophy as Celtic manager at the weekend demonstrated his class. With the hosts' defence a man light while Liam Donnelly was off receiving treatment, a surging run and perfect pass unleashed Christie in the Motherwell box. A neat first touch gave him time, before a crisp finish across Gillespie arrowed into the far bottom corner.It was a game of few chances as Stephen Robinson's side, despite a heroic shift, struggled to repel Celtic for long enough to create any opportunities of their own.Ten minutes after taking the lead, Benkovic had the ball in the net as the large travelling support celebrated, only for referee Kevin Clancy to rule it out for a tug in the box.This should have been a warning for Motherwell, but with half-time approaching, they looked to self destruct. Christie was again at the heart of it, with a rash challenge from Andy Rose bringing him down inside the penalty area. Griffiths stepped up, but Gillespie was equal to his spot kick, diving superbly to his left before then punching clear.
                    
                        
                
                Leigh Griffiths's penalty was saved by Mark GillespieMotherwell emerged stronger in the second half and pushed back the Celtic tide.An Allan Campbell shot straight at Gordon gave them hope, then Sammon saw a low shot smothered by Gordon.The chance looked to have gone for Motherwell but, in the dying seconds, with Celtic clinging on, they struck to claim a precious point. The ball broke to Johnson on the left edge of the box, and with a swipe of his left foot, his shot evaded Gordon's grasp then hit the far post before ruffling the net.Motherwell resilience to the fore - analysisBBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Fir ParkJust as they did twice last season, Motherwell denied Celtic victory at Fir Park with a performance of guts and determination.They refused to accept defeat and showed a resilience that had earned them a similar result against Rangers and an emphatic win over Aberdeen. Robinson has bemoaned his side's inconsistency but they always turn up when the big teams come to Fir Park.It looked like Celtic were on course to return to the top of the league and they played some good football in the first period, but after Griffiths missed the penalty they seldom tested Mark Gillespie.Rodgers cut a frustrated figure at times on the touchline as his team failed to maintain the fluency they had in the early period and ultimately paid the price with Johnson's late equaliser.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsMotherwell20Gillespie22DonnellySubstituted forLivingstoneat 15'minutesBooked at 26minsSubstituted forMainat 72'minutes5Aldred6HartleySubstituted forRoseat 6'minutes2Tait14Grimshaw8CampbellBooked at 38mins4McHugh28Turnbull19Sammon24JohnsonBooked at 35minsSubstitutes9Main12Bowman13Ferguson15Rose17Bigirimana23Gorrin29LivingstoneCeltic1Gordon12Gamboa5Simunovic32Benkovic63Tierney8Brown21NtchamSubstituted forSinclairat 45'minutes15HayesSubstituted forRogicat 81'minutes42McGregor17Christie9GriffithsSubstituted forEdouardat 66'minutesSubstitutes3Izaguirre4Hendry11Sinclair18Rogic22Edouard29Bain49ForrestReferee:Kevin ClancyAttendance:8,433Match StatsHome TeamMotherwellAway TeamCelticPossessionHome38%Away62%ShotsHome6Away8Shots on TargetHome3Away4CornersHome3Away4FoulsHome18Away7Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Motherwell 1, Celtic 1.Full TimePosted at 90'+4' Second Half ends, Motherwell 1, Celtic 1.Goal!Posted at 88' Goal!
