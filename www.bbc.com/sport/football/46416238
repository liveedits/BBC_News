Andy Halliday equalised direct from a free-kick awarded after Nathan Ralph was sent off.Rangers striker Kyle Lafferty had a first-half effort ruled out for offside, after he converted Ryan Kent's cutback.Dundee's point saw them extend their unbeaten run to four games under new manager Jim McIntyre and move off the bottom for the first time since the beginning of September.Rangers have taken only one point from six since moving top of the league last weekend.Reaction & as it happenedWho did you rate man of the match?Dundee defence makes pointMiller provided the home side with a platform to build on, darting between Rangers' sluggish centre-backs to reach a long ball forward and then clip a shot past Allan McGregor.The Dundee striker pointedly refused to celebrate scoring against his former side, but his goal highlighted the chance managers take with squad rotation.Connor Goldson partnered Gareth McAuley in central defence against Aberdeen in midweek, but Gerrard opted on this occasion to pair him with Joe Worrall, and the latter's afternoon was encapsulated when he kicked a straightforward pass out of play.In contrast, Dundee's defenders were alert, well-organised and resolute. They had to be after Ralph was sent off by referee Alan Muir for a tackle on Daniel Candeias on the edge of the area that saw him catch the Rangers winger on the ankle with his studs up. The referee later told McIntyre the dismissal was for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity and the manager confirmed the club will appeal against the decision.Halliday swept the free-kick into the top corner with polished technique and Rangers were briefly energised - culminating in Lafferty's effort being ruled out.Yet Dundee were never swamped and defender Cammy Kerr was typical of the home side's guts and determination. Lining up deep and narrow after the break, Dundee defended their penalty area rigorously, limiting Rangers to sideways passes far from goal and crosses that were dealt with comfortably.Even when the visitors did break through, goalkeeper Jack Hamilton was seldom troubled. When the ball broke to Lafferty inside the area late on, Kerr slid in with a timely challenge before he could shoot.Afterwards, the defender thumped the turf with his fist. It was a hard-earned point, but Dundee deserved it.
                    
                        
                
                Kyle Lafferty's effort was ruled offside with the score 1-1'McIntyre's influence clear against distracted Rangers' - analysisTo play in excess of 70 minutes with just 10 men against one of the strongest teams in the league gives an indication of the mental strength McIntyre has instilled in his players in a short period of time. Yes, they only moved off the bottom on goal difference but, on this performance, they may not be there for too long.Rangers dominated possession and territory and were undoubtedly dealt a raw deal when Lafferty's effort was wrongly ruled out for offside. Gerrard made six changes to the side that lost at home to Aberdeen but they should still have had more than enough quality to secure the win that would have taken them level at the top with Celtic.  Rangers may have had one eye on their midweek trip to Vienna to face Rapid as they seek to continue their Europa League adventure into the New Year. But they cannot afford many more matches like this if they are to somehow wrestle the Premiership flag away from their fierce rivals. 'We had chances on the counter' - reactionDundee manager Jim McIntyre: "The referee gave the red card for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity, which it's not because Andy Boyle is there covering."Originally I thought it was for dangerous and reckless play but it's not. The referee has confirmed that. I'm really disappointed that went against us. We will absolutely appeal it."Rangers manager Steven Gerrard: "It was not good enough. We didn't look like a Rangers team; individually we didn't look like Rangers players. "We kept making stupid decisions. We never really carried out the game plan. So no surprises in terms of the result because our performance didn't deserve better."Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsDundee1Hamilton2Kerr23Boyle5KusungaBooked at 42mins3RalphBooked at 20mins27Curran4WoodsSubstituted forSpenceat 86'minutes8Kamara17Miller18McGowan20MillerSubstituted forKallmanat 76'minutesSubstitutes12Parish14Nabi15Inniss19Kallman28Spence45Moore47LambertRangers1McGregor2Tavernier6Goldson3Worrall16HallidaySubstituted forEjariaat 70'minutes18RossiterSubstituted forBarisicat 57'minutes8JackBooked at 14mins14KentSubstituted forMiddletonat 45'minutes21Candeias11LaffertyBooked at 43mins35GrezdaSubstitutes10Ejaria13Foderingham17McCrorie19Katic23Coulibaly31Barisic40MiddletonReferee:Alan MuirAttendance:8,578Match StatsHome TeamDundeeAway TeamRangersPossessionHome45%Away55%ShotsHome4Away6Shots on TargetHome2Away3CornersHome3Away9FoulsHome7Away11Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Dundee 1, Rangers 1.Full TimePosted at 90'+4' Second Half ends, Dundee 1, Rangers 1.Posted at 90'+2' Corner,  Dundee.
