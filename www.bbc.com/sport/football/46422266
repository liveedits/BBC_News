Everton received the perfect start when another former Watford man, Richarlison, gave them an early lead - although the goal had a large slice of good fortune as Theo Walcott should have been given offside in the build-up.Watford were a threat all night and they capped a fine start to the second half with a 63rd-minute leveller when Roberto Pereyra's shot hit the post and rebounded in off Seamus Coleman.They struck again two minutes later when the outstanding Abdoulaye Doucoure rose above Coleman at the far post to beat Jordan Pickford.Everton were flat throughout, their display summed up when they were awarded a penalty moments after Doucoure's goal when Christian Kabasele fouled Yerry Mina, only for Foster to save Gylfi Digurdsson's tame penalty.Watford were holding on in relative comfort during six minutes of injury time until Digne's crucial last-ditch intervention.Follow all the reaction from Everton v Watford More to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsEverton1Pickford23Coleman4Keane13MinaBooked at 27mins12Digne8André Gomes17GueyeSubstituted forTosunat 71'minutes11WalcottSubstituted forLookmanat 66'minutes10G Sigurdsson20BernardSubstituted forCalvert-Lewinat 66'minutes30RicharlisonSubstitutes3Baines5Zouma14Tosun22Stekelenburg26Davies29Calvert-Lewin31LookmanWatford26Foster21Femenía27KabaseleBooked at 67mins15Cathcart25Holebas16Doucouré20QuinaSubstituted forMariappaat 90+1'minutes12SemaSubstituted forDeulofeuat 60'minutes37Pereyra10SuccessSubstituted forChalobahat 74'minutesBooked at 81mins9DeeneySubstitutes1Gomes6Mariappa7Deulofeu11Masina14Chalobah24Wilmot33OkakaReferee:Kevin FriendAttendance:38,400Match StatsHome TeamEvertonAway TeamWatfordPossessionHome57%Away43%ShotsHome12Away15Shots on TargetHome5Away3CornersHome6Away6FoulsHome13Away13Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Everton 2, Watford 2.Full TimePosted at 90'+7' Second Half ends, Everton 2, Watford 2.Posted at 90'+7' Attempt missed.
