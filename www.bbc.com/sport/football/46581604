"From the other side it looks like it is not the best mood - United lost their last game," said the German."We have our own problems and our own targets and we go for them."We fight for our points. We have to be angry on Sunday and we will be."Liverpool have not beaten United at Anfield in the Premier League since September 2013, with the Old Trafford side winning there in 2015 and 2016.Klopp, whose side are unbeaten in the league this season, added: "It's one of the games which you sign with your contract - try to do everything you have to win it."It's a big one, and if [former United boss] Sir Alex Ferguson says it's the British 'Clasico' then I am really blessed because I was involved in the German Clasico [Borussia Dortmund v Bayern Munich]."It's a cool game."Liverpool 10-1 Man Utd: Who's the only United player to make your combined XI?Match preview: Liverpool v Man Utd (16:00 GMT kick-off)What happened in the Premier League?Statistics do not favour Man Utd
                    
                        
                
                Jose Mourinho: "I know the other team was European champion and that this team won nothing"United have struggled against their closest rivals since manager Jose Mourinho took charge at Old Trafford in 2016:They have faced Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham a combined 24 times in the league, but have won only eight matches.From those matches, they have collected 31 points from a possible 72.They have the second-worst head-to-head record in that mini-league after Arsenal.United have had 263 shots in the 24 previous meetings against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Spurs - 51 fewer than the Gunners, who are next on the list.Mourinho's side have faced 102 more shots on their own goal than Liverpool have in the same group of fixtures.Despite Liverpool's current status as contenders for the title, Mourinho says he does not rate them above the side that won the Champions League in 2005."I played against a Liverpool that was European champion," the former Chelsea boss told Sky Sports."I don't know if it was better or not better; I know the other team was European champion and that this team won nothing. So I think I have to respect the ones that did it, and I have to respect the ambition of the ones that didn't."He added: "They are a good team. The intensity they play at makes the game difficult, but we have to match that and try to improve it."But I think it is important to focus on us, see how we can hurt them and score some goals."
