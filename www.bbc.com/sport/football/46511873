The clean sheet was the key, however, and Liverpool survived a huge scare in injury time when goalkeeper Alisson made a crucial save from Arkadiusz Milik in a rare Napoli opening.Liverpool go through in second place behind Paris St-Germain - a feat achieved despite losing three away games in their group.Follow all the reaction from Anfield and tonight's other Champions League matchesSalah at full throttle once moreSalah started the season slowly after his stellar feats when he scored 44 goals last season - but he has stepped on the throttle in recent weeks and now looks like the player who destroyed defences in domestic and European competition last season.The Egypt forward - fresh from a hat-trick in Liverpool's 4-0 win against Bournemouth - made the difference here, admittedly with the help of a dreadful piece of goalkeeping from Ospina, and his pace, power and movement was often too much for the Italians' defence to cope with.It was all summed up in the goal as he somehow escaped the mountainous figure of Kalidou Koulibaly to make the decisive contribution.Salah's strike was even more significant as his fellow striker Mane, for all his tireless work, had a night in front of goal that he will not recall with pleasure.Salah in full flight, along with his capacity to score crucial goals, is a threat to any defence and his influence will only grow as Liverpool continue their challenge for the Premier League and Champions League crowns.More to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsLiverpool13Alisson66Alexander-ArnoldSubstituted forLovrenat 90'minutes32Matip4van DijkBooked at 13mins26RobertsonBooked at 90mins5Wijnaldum14Henderson7MilnerSubstituted forFabinhoat 85'minutes11SalahBooked at 83mins9Roberto FirminoSubstituted forKeitaat 79'minutes10ManéBooked at 90minsSubstitutes3Fabinho6Lovren8Keita15Sturridge22Mignolet23Shaqiri27OrigiNapoli25Ospina19Maksimovic33Albiol26KoulibalyBooked at 40mins6Mário RuiSubstituted forGhoulamat 70'minutes7Callejón5Marques Loureiro17Hamsik8RuizSubstituted forZielinskiat 62'minutes24Insigne14MertensSubstituted forMilikat 67'minutesSubstitutes11Ounas20Zielinski23Hysaj27Karnezis31Ghoulam42Diawara99MilikReferee:Damir SkominaMatch StatsHome TeamLiverpoolAway TeamNapoliPossessionHome48%Away52%ShotsHome22Away8Shots on TargetHome4Away3CornersHome3Away3FoulsHome16Away6Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Liverpool 1, Napoli 0.Full TimePosted at 90'+5' Second Half ends, Liverpool 1, Napoli 0.Posted at 90'+4' Attempt missed.
