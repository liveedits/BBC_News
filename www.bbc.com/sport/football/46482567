"Step by step," Mourinho said about Fred's progress on Friday."You also have other players in other clubs that needed their time, and you have some of them that played even less than Fred."When the team is defensively stronger and doesn't need people in midfield to give balance to the team, rather than being involved in creation and attacking dynamically, I think the horizons for Fred change completely."More to follow.
