                Tensions were high in Buenos Aires ahead of Saturday's matchBoca players suffered cuts from the glass from broken windows and were also affected by the tear gas used by police to disperse the crowds.A number of players, including Boca's former Manchester City, Manchester United and Juventus striker Carlos Tevez, reportedly suffered from dizziness and vomiting and were being treated by club doctors.Footage apparently from inside the Boca dressing room showed the players groggy and disorientated.Reports said Boca's Pablo Perez and Gonzalo Lamardo had been taken by ambulance to hospital, the former with slivers of broken glass in his eyes and the latter a cut on his head.Earlier, the head of Conmebol, Alejandro Dominguez said he wanted the rescheduled game to pass off smoothly with the safety of the players, technical officials and fans guaranteed.
                    
                        
                
                This is the first time in the 58-year history of the Copa Libertadores the two teams have faced each other in the final of the competition."We call for a peaceful final with respect between rivals to show the best face of South America to the world," he said."We want immediate action from the authorities and will help to identify, capture and prosecute those responsible."The Copa Libertadores is the showpiece club competition in South America, equivalent to the Champions League in Europe. The clubs had agreed to a ban on away fans which mirrors an existing ban in domestic football in Argentina.Three years ago, a last-16 Copa tie between River and Boca at the latter's La Bombonera ground was abandoned at half-time after Boca fans attacked the River players with pepper spray in the tunnel.Boca were kicked out of the competition, while River were given a bye into the quarter-finals.
