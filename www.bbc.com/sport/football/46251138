But Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored what proved to be the winner after the break when he converted Kolasinac's cross for his eighth Premier League goal of the season.After beginning the weekend in sixth, Bournemouth drop two places to eighth and have now lost their past three league matches.The Cherries were aggrieved early on when David Brooks had a goal ruled out for offside, with replays suggesting he was marginally behind Shkodran Mustafi when the ball was played.But that proved to be the catalyst for a confident display from Arsenal, who secured their fourth Premier League away win of the campaign - equalling their tally for the whole of last season.Aubameyang the hero againA run of four draws in their past five games had stemmed some of the excitement generated during the early weeks of manager Unai Emery's reign.But this impressive performance, against a side who began the day just four points behind the Gunners, will raise hopes among supporters that their side can sustain a top-four challenge this season.With Alexandre Lacazette ruled out with a groin injury, Emery switched formation to a back three, with Aubameyang the lone striker.The Gabon international responded by netting again and moving to the top of the Premier League scoring charts alongside Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero.To further highlight his importance to the side, Aubameyang has now been directly involved in 23 goals in 26 league appearances since joining Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund in January.The 29-year-old was ably supported on this occasion by Alex Iwobi and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, with 14 of the Gunners' 20 shots at goal coming from those three players.The formation change also allowed Kolasinac to be a constant threat down the Arsenal left, with the Bosnia-Herzegovina international having a hand in both goals.More to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsBournemouth27Begovic2Francis3S Cook5AkéBooked at 52mins11Daniels20BrooksSubstituted forStanislasat 73'minutes4GoslingSubstituted forL Cookat 73'minutes8LermaBooked at 66mins24Fraser13Wilson17KingSubstituted forMoussetat 82'minutesSubstitutes1Boruc6Surman9Mousset16L Cook18Defoe19Stanislas26MingsArsenal19Leno20Mustafi5PapastathopoulosBooked at 25mins16Holding2Bellerín11TorreiraSubstituted forGuendouziat 79'minutes34Xhaka31Kolasinac7Mkhitaryan17IwobiSubstituted forRamseyat 82'minutes14AubameyangSubstituted forNketiahat 90+4'minutesSubstitutes1Cech4Elneny8Ramsey10Özil15Maitland-Niles29Guendouzi49NketiahReferee:Craig PawsonAttendance:10,792Match StatsHome TeamBournemouthAway TeamArsenalPossessionHome41%Away59%ShotsHome11Away20Shots on TargetHome5Away4CornersHome5Away8FoulsHome6Away9Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Bournemouth 1, Arsenal 2.Full TimePosted at 90'+6' Second Half ends, Bournemouth 1, Arsenal 2.Posted at 90'+6' Attempt missed.
