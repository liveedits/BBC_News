Northern Ireland have lost all four matches in the new Uefa competition.
                    
                        
                
                The late goal was a cruel blow for Northern Ireland who have now won only twice in their last 13 matchesThe hosts knew they were relegated from the Nations League Group B3 before Sunday's kick-off but they had wanted to try to end 2018 on a high - and the home fans will have recognised their efforts to do so.After a first half in which there was little between the sides, Austria took a 49th-minute lead after an impressive left-wing move. Bayern Munich's David Alaba cleverly left the pass inside and Schlager swept home a low left foot shot into the bottom corner for his first international goal.Evans' equaliser was his second goal for Northern Ireland and came 45 games after his first in 2010. George Saville pressed well in midfield and the ball came to Jordan Jones on the left wing, who slipped it inside to Evans whose deflected left-foot shot deceived goalkeeper Heinz Lindner. Ultimately, though, it counted for little as the Austrians secured their first win in Belfast at the fifth attempt.Superb Saville one for the future
                    
                        
                
                Middlesbrough midfielder George Saville impressed once again in a Northern Ireland shirtHe has been earmarked by some Northern Ireland fans as the long-term successor to captain Steven Davis in the Northern Ireland midfield, and that may well prove to be the case for George Saville.But the Middlesbrough man, who was introduced to the team towards the end of the last World Cup qualifying campaign, has already formed a fine axis with the skipper in a three-man engine room with scorer Corry Evans.Saville was superb once again in the middle of the park for O'Neill, closing the Austrians down throughout and even more impressive as a driving force when in possession. His pressing helped lead to Evans' goal and he almost put his side 2-1 up in the 76th minute. He got on the ball 20 yards from goal and hit a searching shot with his cultured left foot that curled just wide of the post. Oliver Norwood was suspended for this game and may find it difficult to force his way back into the midfield, with Davis once again a huge influence on the team and Evans proving his worth with the goal. NI manager's change of style O'Neill's side had a definite style of play for the recent Euro and World Cup qualifying campaigns. The team had a compact shape, was often happy to surrender possession and look to hurt the opposition on the break.   With the utmost attention paid to every detail by the manager, it was a percentage game that may not have been easy on the eye of the neutral, but which proved effective.
                    
                        
                
                An equaliser by Corry Evans did not save Michael O'Neill's men from another Nations League defeatThe ball moved from back to front quickly, often to target man Kyle Lafferty, and Northern Ireland reaped a lot of joy from well-rehearsed set-pieces.There has been a noticeable change of style from O'Neill this season, with a much greater focus on possession and building attacks from the back. That element has been successful but they had failed to score in five of their last six competitive matches before Sunday night.Northern Ireland once again looked comfortable on the ball against Austria, but, unlike in Thursday night's friendly in Dublin, they did not create many clear-cut chances.O'Neill has four months to think about how his side continues to evolve before they start their Euro qualifier campaign in March.Run without a win goes on - the statsNorthern Ireland are winless in their last eight competitive games (D1 L7), their worst run since going nine  without victory between September 2011 and March 2013.Austria scored with both of their shots on target in this game, courtesy of Xaver Schlager and Valentin Lazaro. Neither player had previously scored for their country.After keeping a clean sheet in four consecutive competitive home games, Northern Ireland have conceded in each of their last four.Corry Evans' equaliser was Northern Ireland's first goal in 350 minutes of action since Gavin Whyte netted in the 67th minute against Israel in September.Evans scored his first goal for Northern Ireland since September 2010 versus Slovenia, 2998 days ago.Austria's Marko Arnautovic has been directly involved in 26 goals (15 goals and 11 assists) in 37 games for club and country in 2018, compared to 19 involvements in 44 games in 2017 (13 goals and six assists).Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsNorthern Ireland1Carson22Smith4McAuleyBooked at 79mins5Evans14Dallas13EvansSubstituted forMcNairat 88'minutes8Davis6Saville7McGinnSubstituted forWhyteat 74'minutes9BoyceSubstituted forLaffertyat 74'minutes15JonesSubstitutes2McLaughlin3Thompson10Lafferty11Ferguson12McGovern16Whyte17McNair18Hughes19Vassell20Cathcart21Magennis23HazardAustria1Lindner20Lainer3Dragovic4Hinteregger2Ulmer14BaumgartlingerBooked at 52mins6IlsankerSubstituted forZuljat 45'minutes22Lazaro23Schlager8AlabaBooked at 79mins11GregoritschSubstituted forArnautovicat 71'minutesSubstitutes5Wimmer7Arnautovic9Goiginger10Schaub12Strebinger13Stankovic16Zulj17Kainz18Schöpf19Hierländer21JankoReferee:Jonathan LardotMatch StatsHome TeamNorthern IrelandAway TeamAustriaPossessionHome43%Away57%ShotsHome8Away10Shots on TargetHome2Away2CornersHome5Away1FoulsHome9Away11Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Northern Ireland 1, Austria 2.Full TimePosted at 90'+4' Second Half ends, Northern Ireland 1, Austria 2.Goal!Posted at 90'+3' Goal!
