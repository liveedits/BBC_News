"With 20 minutes to go, I was actually enjoying the fact that maybe we all should suffer," head coach Neville told BBC Sport."Sometimes in life you have got to put yourself through a little bit of pain to get where you want to."For the last 12 months everything has been going really smoothly and there's a massive euphoria, and rightly so. But along the way, you're going to get bumps. This feels like a bump in the road, and a jolt for us."Today was what we needed. I do think that we needed it, the whole of the FA women's division."It's just a little bump in the road to remind everyone that no one is going to just give us the World Cup. We've got to keep working hard."Relive England Women's defeat by Sweden
                    
                        
                
                Sweden celebrate Anna Anvegard's close-range strike that put the visitors 2-0 aheadThe defeat was Neville's second loss as head coach, and first at home, and saw the Lionesses end 2018 with seven wins, three draws and two losses from his 12 games in charge.Up against a Swedish side ranked ninth in the world, England - who sit third in Fifa's rankings - were beaten at home for the first time since a 1-0 loss to the USA at Stadium MK in February 2015.Robust and well-organised Sweden, who won silver at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, gave the hosts a masterclass in defending at times, on a day when two moments of relatively uncharacteristically sloppy play at the back cost the Lionesses.England dominated after the break, as they tried to get back in the game, but substitute Toni Duggan's fizzing effort was saved and the Women's Super League's new record scorer Nikita Parris headed wide at the far post.Swedes spoil skipper Houghton's special day
