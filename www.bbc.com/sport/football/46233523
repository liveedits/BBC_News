Sheffield United midfielder John Fleck had earlier been added to the squad for Tuesday's Nations League match with Israel at Hampden.He will join up with McLeish's pool of players after they return from Albania.The 27-year-old was capped at under-21 level but has never been involved with the senior set-up before.McLeish confident of right-back solutionMcGinn is eighth player out of Scotland squadTierney? Paterson? Fraser? Pick your Scotland XINations League: Where do Scotland stand?The loss of Tierney reduces McLeish's options in defence while at the same time resolving the conundrum of finding a place for two top-quality left-backs.Tierney has been used on the left of a three-man central defence, with Liverpool's Andrew Robertson pushed into a wing-back role on the left.With Kilmarnock's Stephen O'Donnell having withdrawn from the squad, leaving McLeish without a natural right-back, using Tierney on the other flank and reverting to a back four had been an option open to the head coach.McLeish had said that he had noted Callum Paterson's form in a forward role for Cardiff City, but the 24-year-old is an option at right-back, having played there previously for his country and Hearts.Bournemouth winger Ryan Fraser has previously been used by Scotland as a right wing-back.
                    
                        
                
                Fleck has scored once in 16 Championship games this seasonFleck's call-up had come after Aston Villa midfielder John McGinn became the eighth player to drop out of the original squad for the double header.Assistant coach James McFadden explained: "Rather than have John travel from Sheffield to Edinburgh, on to Albania and back to Glasgow in the space of 48 hours, without having the opportunity to train with the team, it is better for him to join on Sunday and be physically and mentally prepared to focus on our match on Tuesday."The coaching staff have settled on the plan to play Albania and have been preparing on this basis all week."John has been in fine form for a successful Sheffield United side this season and his inclusion in the squad will offer us a fresh option against Israel."Fleck, previously with Rangers and Coventry City, has made 17 appearances for his club this season, with the Blades sitting fourth in England's Championship.Scotland squad
