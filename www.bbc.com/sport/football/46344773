However, Aguero reacted quickest to flick in a header two minutes later to earn City what could be a vital point.City remain top of Group F on 10 points - three clear of Lyon - meaning a draw in their final game against Hoffenheim will be enough to progress as group winners.Finishing top would ensure City will not be drawn against another group winner - with the likes of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Juventus currently topping their groups - in the last 16.Lyon looked set to join City in qualifying for the knockout stage with the draw, until Shakhtar Donetsk scored a late winner for a 3-2 victory at Hoffenheim.The French side still need a point in their final game against Shakhtar in Ukraine to progress.Follow all the reaction from tonight's Champions League gamesSubstance over style for CityPremier League leaders City have swept aside almost everything put in front of them domestically this season, but were given another tough test by a Lyon team which had been the only one to beat them in their previous 26 matches.The French side, who are second in Ligue 1 but 15 points adrift of leaders Paris St-Germain, won 2-1 at Etihad Stadium in the opening group game back in September.Again they caused City problems with their pace and power in the attacking third, with former Manchester United forward Memphis Depay and Cornet - who also scored in the reverse fixture - at the heart of their most potent play.City have only conceded five goals in 13 Premier League matches this season, but Lyon have shown they can be vulnerable after scoring four against them in 180 minutes.While City were uncharacteristically opened up at the back, they showed characteristics of a great side which they have not had to show too often under Pep Guardiola: the resilience to fight back from behind.City lacked their usual attacking rhythm - more down to Lyon's intensity than a lack of their own - but showed their quality at set-pieces through Laporte and Aguero to earn a hard-fought draw."Lyon have good players in good areas and quick players but we got a good draw," City defender Kyle Walker said."That shows the character and belief in the dressing room. Important players come good at the right time."Man of the match - Aymeric Laporte (Man City)
                    
                        
                
                Laporte joined City from Athletic Bilbao for a club record fee of £57m in JanuaryFrench centre-back Laporte is the only outfield player to have played every minute in the Premier League for Manchester City this season, and again he illustrated his importance to Guardiola's side with another commanding display.The 24-year-old reads the game wonderfully and came to City's rescue in the first half on a couple of occasions, notably when he blocked a golden chance for Cornet.While Laporte could do little to stop Cornet eventually opening the scoring, he dragged City back into the match when he was perfectly placed at the other end to steer in a header from Raheem Sterling's free-kick.That gave City renewed confidence, perhaps also adding to their belief they could fight back for a second time in a dramatic conclusion to the game.The only mystifying thing about Laporte's performance is how he continues to be overlooked by France and still without international recognition.City in familiar territory of the last 16 - the statsAfter failing to get out of the group in their first two Champions League campaigns, Man City have reached the knockout stage in each of the last six seasons.Lyon are unbeaten in their first five group-stage games in the Champions League for the first time since 2008-09.Sergio Aguero has scored in each of his last six Champions League away appearances - only Cristiano Ronaldo (12) has a longer scoring streak on the road.Maxwel Cornet has scored in both of his Champions League appearances versus Manchester City (3 goals).David Silva has provided more assists for Man City in the Champions League than any other player (9).What's next?Back to the Premier League for City, who are aiming to extend their two-point lead at the top when they host Bournemouth on Saturday (15:00 GMT).That final Champions League group game against Hoffenheim, who are already eliminated, takes place at Etihad Stadium on 12 December.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsLyon1Lopes5Denayer6Guedes Filho20Marçal de Oliveira4Pereira da SilvaSubstituted forTeteat 74'minutes28NDombele8Aouar22MendyBooked at 62mins27CornetSubstituted forTerrierat 89'minutes18FekirSubstituted forTraoréat 84'minutes11DepaySubstitutes7Terrier10Traoré15Morel23Tete24Diop Gueye29Tousart30GorgelinMan City31Ederson2Walker5Stones14Laporte35Zinchenko7SterlingBooked at 34mins25FernandinhoBooked at 23mins21Silva26Mahrez10AgüeroSubstituted forFodenat 90+1'minutes19SanéSubstituted forDelphat 71'minutesSubstitutes3Danilo4Kompany18Delph30Otamendi47Foden49Muric55DiazReferee:Gianluca RocchiMatch StatsHome TeamLyonAway TeamMan CityPossessionHome41%Away59%ShotsHome12Away13Shots on TargetHome4Away6CornersHome1Away7FoulsHome5Away11Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Lyon 2, Manchester City 2.Full TimePosted at 90'+3' Second Half ends, Lyon 2, Manchester City 2.SubstitutionPosted at 90'+1' Substitution, Manchester City.
