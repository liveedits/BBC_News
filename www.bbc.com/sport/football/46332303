Those days seem like a long time ago now, with United proving a fading force in front of goal since Sir Alex retired in 2013.Instead, cries of 'attack, attack, attack' are common place from the home crowd at Old Trafford as they urge their side to regain some of their offensive magic.Saturday's dour goalless draw with Crystal Palace was United's 65th 0-0 draw in the 26 seasons of the Premier League. But what is notable about that statistic is that 20 of those draws - 31 percent - have come in the six seasons since Sir Alex's retirement in 2013.That is six more than any of their 'big six' rivals over the same period.The 'big six' Premier League goalless draws since start of 2013-14 seasonManchester United20Chelsea14Liverpool14Arsenal12Manchester City12Tottenham Hotspur10United have had three managers in that time - David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Mourinho. It won't be surprising to hear all three have an inferior goals-to-game ratio than Sir Alex.Mourinho's goals-per-game ratio of 1.6 is an improvement on his predecessor Van Gaal, who averaged 1.46 goals a game during his two-year spell in charge.Manchester United - goals-per-game in the Premier LeagueManagerGamesGoalsGoals-per-gameSir Alex Ferguson81016272.01David Moyes34561.65Jose Mourinho891421.60Louis van Gaal761111.46And one player who has impressed in front of goal for United this season is Anthony Martial, with the Frenchman scoring six so far. So, despite United's struggles, they have a contender for the Golden Boot - but he faces some stiff competition.It's tight at the topMohamed Salah and Harry Kane dominated the race for the Premier League Golden Boot last season. Liverpool forward Salah claimed the award with 32 goals - two ahead of Kane - but their nearest challenger, Manchester City's Sergio Aguero, scored nine fewer.This season is shaping up to be much more competitive, with four times the number of players on seven goals or more compared to the same stage of last season. Salah topped the charts this time last year with 10 goals - two ahead of United's Romelu Lukaku - with Alexandre Lacazette, Jamie Vardy and Leroy Sane the nearest challengers on six.This time around, it is Aguero and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who lead the way with eight, but with six players are lurking just behind them on seven.Aubameyang has the best scoring ratio of the group, averaging a goal every 118 minutes for Arsenal this season.Premier League top scorers 2018-19PlayerGoalsAssistsMinutes-per-goalSergio Aguero84121Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang81118Raheem Sterling76134Eden Hazard74125Mohamed Salah73160 Harry Kane71166Aleksandar Mitrovic71167 Glenn Murray70142On me head, son!One of those players on seven goals is Aleksandar Mitrovic, who scored twice for Fulham against Southampton on Saturday to ensure Claudio Ranieri's reign as manager got off to a winning start.Mitrovic's first-half opener at Craven Cottage was his fourth headed goal this season - more than any other player. With just a third of the campaign gone, it puts the Serbian on course to reach double figures for headed goals - something no player has achieved in the Premier League. Everton's Duncan Ferguson is the current record holder with nine headed goals during the 1997-98 season.Sunday FundayArsenal's qualification for the Europa League has seen a number of their Premier League fixtures switched from a Saturday to a Sunday. That Thursday/Sunday grind is seen as an inconvenience by many - but not Aubameyang.His winner for Arsenal at the Vitality Stadium on Sunday means he has now scored 14 goals in 16 Premier League matches played on a Sunday - 78% of his total for the club.No other player with 10 or more Premier League goals has scored as big a percentage on that day, though interestingly Aubameyang's Arsenal team-mate Alexandre Lacazette is joint-fourth on the list with 57.9%.Premier League goals scored on a SundayPlayerTotal goalsSunday goalsPercentage Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang181477.8%Jack Rodwell10660%Divock Origi12758.3%Alexandre Lacazette191157.9%Georginio Wijnaldum191157.9%London callingManchester City and Tottenham were victorious in London on Saturday and both clubs have reason to enjoy playing in the capital right now.City's 4-0 thrashing of West Ham saw them become just the second non-London club to win six consecutive top-flight games in the capital, equalling a feat achieved by Portsmouth 67 years ago.Tottenham, meanwhile, beat Chelsea at Wembley to move above the Blues into third and continue manager Mauricio Pochettino's impressive record against fellow London sides. That was the Argentine's 22nd London derby victory - no other club has won more since he took charge of Spurs in the summer of 2014.Next up for Tottenham? Arsenal at Emirates Stadium next weekend.
