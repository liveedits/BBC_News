Loic Nego put Vidi ahead with a fantastic volley but Olivier Giroud scored a stunning free-kick equaliser. Morata hurt his knee while shooting from Callum Hudson-Odoi's cross late in the first half and had to be replaced by Giroud - who is now the Blues' only fit striker.Boss Maurizio Sarri says he does not think the injury is too serious, with an update expected on Friday.The Blues had won their opening five Europa League games, and are joined in the knockout stages by Bate Borisov, who beat PAOK Salonika in the other game. Vidi could have qualified - but needed to better the Belarusian side's result.Chelsea condemn anti-Semitic chantsChelsea short on striking optionsDid Sarri need to name such a strong team for an ultimately irrelevant match in Budapest?He even admitted before the game that it was a "difficult match to prepare for" with nothing on the line. They named two players under 21 in their starting line-up, with another two on the bench. Arsenal named twice as many for their match in similar circumstances against Qarabag.Chelsea only have two established strikers at the club - excluding those out on loan - and they could be down to one depending on the severity of Morata's injuryEden Hazard - who was rested for this game - started up front in Sunday's 2-0 win over Manchester City and might be needed to reprise that role again.Sunday's Premier League trip to Brighton is the first of seven games in three weeks.Blues' fringe players fail to impress
                    
                        
                
                Giroud has scored four goals in his last three Europa League appearancesChelsea's two teenagers had mixed fortunes with usually impressive defender Ampadu, already a senior Wales international, heading past his own goalkeeper from a flicked-on corner.Forward Hudson-Odoi had another bright game and forced two saves from Vidi's Adam Kovacsik.Morata - who has only managed 10 goals in 2018 - looked short on confidence again, missing several chances before his injury.And players like Emerson Palmieri, Ross Barkley, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Fabregas did little to stake a place in the first-choice line-up.Willian, the only player to keep his place from the win over City, opened the scoring with a central free-kick, which Kovacsik should have stopped.Only 116 seconds later Vidi were level from Ampadu's own goal.The hosts then led when Nego, a former Charlton Athletic player, hit a brilliant volley past Willy Caballero from Georgi Milanov's cross. He had already forced two saves from Chelsea's back-up goalkeeper by that stage.But substitute Giroud saved their Europa League unbeaten record with a fine free-kick that not even a defender on the post could keep out. 'Satisfied with the character'Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri: "We made a lot of mistakes from the tactical point of view. I am very happy with the character and with the reaction from the second goal."On the pitch there was a lot of young players so it wasn't easy to react."From the tactical point of view we made a lot of mistakes. We lost a lot of ball. We can manage the ball better I think. At the end, especially with the young players I am satisfied with the character."Chelsea follow in Liverpool footsteps - match statsChelsea are the first side to score from two direct free-kicks in a single Europa League game since Liverpool against Zenit St Petersburg back in February 2013.Chelsea are unbeaten in their last nine Europa League games (W8 D1), last suffering defeat in the competition against Ruben Kazan in the second leg of the 2012-13 quarter-finals.Vidi are just the second side to score two goals against Chelsea in a Europa League game after Ruben Kazan back in April 2013.Vidi have lost just two of their last seven home Europa League games (W3 D2). Since his Chelsea debut, Willian has scored 10 direct free kicks for the Blues - six more than any other Chelsea player (Marcos Alonso - 4).Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsMOL Vidi74Kovacsik5Fiola23JuhászBooked at 66mins3Souza dos SantosBooked at 73mins22dos Santos Tavares11NegoBooked at 76mins8HadzicSubstituted forPátkaiat 85'minutes19Nikolov9HusztiBooked at 69minsSubstituted forHodzicat 81'minutes77MilanovSubstituted forKovácsat 81'minutes44ScepovicSubstitutes10Kovács12Tujvel13Berecz15Hodzic17Pátkai25Tamas65HangyaChelsea13Caballero21Zappacosta44Ampadu27Christensen33Emerson8Barkley4Fàbregas12Loftus-CheekBooked at 79mins20Hudson-Odoi29MorataSubstituted forGiroudat 45+1'minutes22WillianSubstituted forPedroat 56'minutesSubstitutes3Alonso5Jorginho11Pedro18Giroud30David Luiz52Cumming55McEachranReferee:Aleksandar StavrevMatch StatsHome TeamMOL VidiAway TeamChelseaPossessionHome24%Away76%ShotsHome6Away18Shots on TargetHome3Away5CornersHome3Away11FoulsHome15Away14Live TextPosted at   Match ends, MOL Vidi 2, Chelsea 2.Full TimePosted at 90'+4' Second Half ends, MOL Vidi 2, Chelsea 2.Posted at 90'+1' Attempt blocked.
