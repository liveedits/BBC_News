Five minutes after half-time Jesus powerfully headed in his second from a pinpoint Sane cross.Dominic Calvert-Lewin pulled a goal back for the visitors with a 65th-minute header but just four minutes later substitute Raheem Sterling regained City's two-goal lead.Three minutes after coming off the bench, the England forward was left unmarked in the six-yard box to head in a cross from Fernandinho to score with his first touch.Midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, who has been out with a knee injury, came on as a substitute in the 75th minute for his first appearance since 1 November.The win takes City two points clear of Liverpool, who will return to the top of the table if they beat Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday.Reaction to City's win at the EtihadMore to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsMan City31Ederson2Walker30Otamendi14Laporte18DelphBooked at 76mins20Bernardo Silva25Fernandinho8Gündogan26MahrezSubstituted forDe Bruyneat 75'minutes33Gabriel Jesus19SanéSubstituted forSterlingat 66'minutesSubstitutes5Stones7Sterling10Agüero17De Bruyne35Zinchenko47Foden49MuricEverton1Pickford23ColemanSubstituted forWalcottat 57'minutes5Zouma4Keane13Mina12DigneBooked at 19mins30Richarlison8André Gomes10G SigurdssonSubstituted forDaviesat 81'minutes20BernardSubstituted forLookmanat 57'minutes29Calvert-LewinBooked at 76minsSubstitutes3Baines11Walcott14Tosun18Schneiderlin22Stekelenburg26Davies31LookmanReferee:Craig PawsonMatch StatsHome TeamMan CityAway TeamEvertonPossessionHome67%Away33%ShotsHome13Away9Shots on TargetHome5Away2CornersHome6Away2FoulsHome7Away9Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Manchester City 3, Everton 1.Full TimePosted at 90'+5' Second Half ends, Manchester City 3, Everton 1.Posted at 90'+4' Foul by Fernandinho (Manchester City).Posted at 90'+4' Ademola Lookman (Everton) wins a free kick in the attacking half.Posted at 90'+4' Foul by Bernardo Silva (Manchester City).Posted at 90'+4' Ademola Lookman (Everton) wins a free kick in the defensive half.Posted at 90'+1' Corner,  Everton.
