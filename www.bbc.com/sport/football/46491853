This victory, City's 10th league win in a row at home, was rarely in serious doubt once Jesus had fired his side ahead on a bitterly cold day at Etihad Stadium.Yerry Mina's misplaced pass allowed Ilkay Gundogan to find Leroy Sane in space, and he sent Jesus galloping into the area to score with a fine low finish.It was the Brazilian's first league goal since August - a run of 11 games and 487 minutes without finding the net - but he only had to wait another 28 minutes for his second of the game.When it arrived just after half-time, Sane was the provider again - with Jesus meeting his precise cross to plant an unstoppable header past Toffees keeper Jordan Pickford.City looked in complete control but Everton gave themselves hope just after the hour when Dominic Calvert Lewin met Lucas Digne's cross to reduce the deficit.The visitors were only briefly back in it, however, with substitute Sterling heading in Fernandinho's cross four minutes later.It was enough to ensure City, whose loss at Stamford Bridge last weekend was their first in the league this season, are back in a familiar position at the top.Kevin de Bruyne, back from a knee injury that has kept him out of action since 1 November, also came off the bench before the end to give the home fans further reason to cheer.Reaction to City's win at the EtihadMore to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsMan City31Ederson2Walker30Otamendi14Laporte18DelphBooked at 76mins20Bernardo Silva25Fernandinho8Gündogan26MahrezSubstituted forDe Bruyneat 75'minutes33Gabriel Jesus19SanéSubstituted forSterlingat 66'minutesSubstitutes5Stones7Sterling10Agüero17De Bruyne35Zinchenko47Foden49MuricEverton1Pickford23ColemanSubstituted forWalcottat 57'minutes5Zouma4Keane13Mina12DigneBooked at 19mins30Richarlison8André Gomes10G SigurdssonSubstituted forDaviesat 81'minutes20BernardSubstituted forLookmanat 57'minutes29Calvert-LewinBooked at 76minsSubstitutes3Baines11Walcott14Tosun18Schneiderlin22Stekelenburg26Davies31LookmanReferee:Craig PawsonMatch StatsHome TeamMan CityAway TeamEvertonPossessionHome67%Away33%ShotsHome13Away9Shots on TargetHome5Away2CornersHome6Away2FoulsHome7Away9Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Manchester City 3, Everton 1.Full TimePosted at 90'+5' Second Half ends, Manchester City 3, Everton 1.Posted at 90'+4' Foul by Fernandinho (Manchester City).Posted at 90'+4' Ademola Lookman (Everton) wins a free kick in the attacking half.Posted at 90'+4' Foul by Bernardo Silva (Manchester City).Posted at 90'+4' Ademola Lookman (Everton) wins a free kick in the defensive half.Posted at 90'+1' Corner,  Everton.
