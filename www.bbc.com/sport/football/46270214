Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus struck the post for Brazil in the second half, while Arthur hit the crossbar with a long-range effort.The 29,669 fans at Stadium MK cheered loudly when Neymar came out to warm-up, but were equally displeased when he hobbled off.Brazil team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar said: "He felt discomfort. He will need a bit more time to evaluate it and take a scan, but in principle it is not a serious injury."Those thoughts were later confirmed by the player, who wrote on Instagram: "Thanks to everyone who sent me messages wishing me a quick recovery, I don't think it's anything serious."Elsewhere, his fellow PSG forward Kylian Mbappe went off with a shoulder injury during France's friendly against Uruguay.The French champions' next match is at home to Toulouse on Saturday.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsBrazil23Ederson2Danilo4Marquinhos16Nascimento de Castro12Lobo Silva18Marques Loureiro5Ramos de Oliveira Melo15PaulinhoSubstituted forSouza Silvaat 69'minutes19WillianSubstituted forDouglas Costaat 68'minutes20Roberto FirminoSubstituted forGabriel Jesusat 45'minutes10NeymarSubstituted forRicharlisonat 8'minutesSubstitutes1Alisson3Miranda6Filipe Luís7Douglas Costa8Renato Augusto9Gabriel Jesus11Rafinha13Vital da Silva14Fabinho17Souza Silva21Richarlison22Nascimento Resende BrazãoCameroon1OnanaSubstituted forOndoaat 45'minutes15Fuchs22Kana-Biyik4Banana3Bong14MandjeckBooked at 19mins6KundeSubstituted forOlingaat 76'minutes10Sutchuin-Djoum13Choupo-MotingSubstituted forN'Jieat 65'minutes7Toko EkambiSubstituted forZouaat 89'minutes9BahokenSubstituted forBassogogat 68'minutesSubstitutes2Fai5Ngadeu-Ngadjui11Bassogog12Dawa16Ondoa17N'Jie18Olinga19Zoua20Kaptoum21OnguénéReferee:Michael OliverMatch StatsHome TeamBrazilAway TeamCameroonPossessionHome61%Away39%ShotsHome23Away5Shots on TargetHome9Away1CornersHome7Away4FoulsHome14Away12Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Brazil 1, Cameroon 0.Full TimePosted at 90'+3' Second Half ends, Brazil 1, Cameroon 0.Posted at 90'+2' Offside, Cameroon.
