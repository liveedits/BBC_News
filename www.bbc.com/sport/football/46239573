A Dutch draw in Germany on Monday would see them win the group.That would take Ronald Koeman's side into next June's Nations League finals - at the expense of France, who had only needed a point in Rotterdam to seal top spot.The winners of each group are also guaranteed a Euro 2020 play-off place if they fail to progress from qualification next year.France can still win the group if the Germans, who will be in the Nations League second tier in 2020, beat the Dutch.Elsewhere, Gibraltar's Euro 2020 dream is almost certainly over after a 6-2 hammering by Armenia. The minnows led through teenager Tjay de Barr but Yura Movsisyan scored four times for the visitors.Macedonia remain top of that group - and are 90 minutes away from the play-offs - thanks to a 2-0 win in Liechstenstein.Wales' promotion bid is over after a 2-1 defeat by Denmark - who win the group and a place in the 2020 top flight. That result relegates the Republic of Ireland.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsNetherlands1Cillessen2Dumfries3de Ligt4van Dijk5Blind6de Roon7de Jong9BergwijnSubstituted forPromesat 86'minutes8WijnaldumBooked at 17minsSubstituted forVilhenaat 89'minutes11BabelSubstituted forAkéat 90+1'minutes10DepaySubstitutes12Tete13Zoet14de Vrij15Aké16Strootman17van de Beek18Rosario19de Jong20Promes21Vilhena22Dilrosun23BizotFrance1Lloris2PavardBooked at 72mins4Varane3Kimpembe12DigneBooked at 57mins13KantéBooked at 50mins15NzonziSubstituted forNDombeleat 81'minutes14MatuidiSubstituted forSissokoat 65'minutes7Griezmann9GiroudSubstituted forDembéléat 65'minutesBooked at 89mins10MbappéSubstitutes5Sakho6Sissoko8Pléa11Dembélé16Mandanda17Rami18Fekir19Sidibe20Thauvin21NDombele22Mendy23AreolaReferee:Anthony TaylorMatch StatsHome TeamNetherlandsAway TeamFrancePossessionHome59%Away41%ShotsHome18Away7Shots on TargetHome11Away2CornersHome8Away2FoulsHome9Away14Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Netherlands 2, France 0.Full TimePosted at 90'+7' Second Half ends, Netherlands 2, France 0.Goal!Posted at 90'+6' Goal!
