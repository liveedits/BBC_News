"It's totally untrue," said agent Jorge Mendes in a statement. Mourinho reluctant to pick Â£47m Fred until Man Utd 'defensively stronger'"Jose is very happy at the club and the club is very happy with him. He has a long-term contract with Manchester United and is fully committed to the club in building a solid winning project."As well as Mourinho being linked with Real, there have been media reports suggesting United are considering bringing in Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino to succeed Mourinho.United play Fulham at home on Saturday before trips to Valencia in the Champions League on Wednesday, and Liverpool in the league on 16 December.Analysis Simon Stone, BBC football correspondentJorge Mendes rarely talks in public, so there is huge significance around the statement that has been released on his behalf.The big question is what the significance actually is.For that, there has to be an answer to whether United knew it was coming out, and, more importantly, whether they agree with its contents.One line in there is particularly interesting, namely that United "are very happy" with Mourinho.Given United go into this weekend's fixtures eighth in the Premier League, 18 points behind leaders Manchester City and 14 in front of the drop zone, having collected just three points from their past four games, I can't imagine anyone, including Mourinho, can be very happy at the moment.Anything other than a victory over rock-bottom Fulham at Old Trafford on Saturday and the noise around Mourinho will intensify significantly, and no end of statements from Mendes will change that.
