It comes after football fans urged clubs not to "stick their hands down the back of the sofa" and contribute to Scudamore's departing gift.Scudamore - who reportedly earns £2.5m per season - is stepping down in December after 19 years at the organisation.The Premier League's UK television rights were valued at about £670m when Scudamore joined the organisation in 1999, while the most recent deal was worth £5.14bn.All 20 Premier League clubs were asked by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck for a £250,000 contribution - something which fans "strongly opposed"."Premier League clubs have always told fan groups that budgets are planned in advance and there's not a surplus of cash lying around from their extremely lucrative TV deal," said the Football Supporters' Federation (FSF)."In the meantime, loyal football supporters continue to be inconvenienced by fixture changes to fit TV schedules, often losing out on travel costs or struggling to get to and from games in the first place. "Now it appears clubs can stick their hands down the back of the sofa and find £250,000 at a moment's notice."Speaking outside the meeting of all Premier League clubs on Thursday, West Ham co-chairman David Gold said he backed the payment to Scudamore."He deserves everything he gets," Gold said. "This is all very appropriate and we're all very pleased."On Tuesday, the Premier League announced that Susanna Dinnage will be its new chief executive.
