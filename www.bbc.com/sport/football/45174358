                Northern Ireland's Jordan Jones had one of the best chances but failed to make it countThe Republic's recent form has not been much better, with a 2-1 friendly victory over the USA in June now their only victory in their last 10 outings.They are bottom of their Group B4 Nations League table, having drawn one and lost two of their three matches and will complete their campaign with a trip to Denmark on Monday. Randolph to Republic's rescueNorthern Ireland have been creating plenty of chances in recent matches without taking them and that was the case again in Thursday's friendly.Oxford United winger Whyte had the first big opportunity of the night in the 14th minute when Liam Boyce released Stuart Dallas down the left with a hooked pass and he showed great composure to square the ball to Whyte.
                    
                        
                
                Darren Randolph's saves earned him the man of the match awardThe former Crusaders man, who has been in fine form since joining Oxford in the summer, took a touch and Randolph raced off his line to make a superb save at his feet.Randolph had to show all of his awareness again in the 72nd minute to ensure a terrible mistake by defender Darragh Lenihan did not lead to a crucial goal.Kilmarnock player Jones was not long off the bench when he pounced to rob Lenihan of possession to go through on goal, but his shot was too close to the advancing Middlesbrough keeper who once again made an excellent save.More to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsR. of Ireland23Randolph18LenihanBooked at 16minsSubstituted forChristieat 84'minutes4Duffy5Egan2Coleman13Hendrick6WhelanSubstituted forHourihaneat 36'minutesBooked at 63mins10Brady11McCleanSubstituted forStevensat 66'minutes8O'DowdaSubstituted forCurtisat 45'minutes14RobinsonSubstituted forMaguireat 66'minutesSubstituted forHoganat 80'minutesSubstitutes1Doyle3Christie7Williams9Maguire12Stevens15Curtis16Kelleher17Hourihane19Hogan20Obafemi21Long22ArterNorthern Ireland1Peacock-Farrell22SmithSubstituted forWardat 74'minutes20Cathcart5Evans3Lewis8Davis16WhyteSubstituted forJonesat 61'minutes13EvansSubstituted forMcNairat 65'minutes6SavilleBooked at 76mins14Dallas9BoyceSubstituted forLaffertyat 71'minutesSubstitutes2McLaughlin4McAuley7McGinn10Lafferty11Ferguson12McGovern15Jones17McNair18Hughes19Ward21Magennis23HazardReferee:Slavko VincicAttendance:31,241Match StatsHome TeamR. of IrelandAway TeamNorthern IrelandPossessionHome42%Away58%ShotsHome8Away11Shots on TargetHome2Away3CornersHome3Away11FoulsHome11Away15Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Republic of Ireland 0, Northern Ireland 0.Full TimePosted at 90'+5' Second Half ends, Republic of Ireland 0, Northern Ireland 0.Posted at 90'+3' Offside, Republic of Ireland.
