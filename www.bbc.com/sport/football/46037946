Alexandre Lacazette scored the only goal of a tame match with a slick 16th-minute winner from Mesut Ozil's pass.
    
        
After the break, Eddie Nketiah had a headed goal ruled out for offside.And in the 89th-minute, 17-year-old winger Bukayo Saka missed a chance to become Arsenal's youngest goalscorer in Europe as he smashed a finish into the face of Qarabag goalkeeper Vagner.Koscielny, 33, ruptured his Achilles in last season's semi-finals defeat by Atletico Madrid. He had very little work to do against Qarabag, who only went close when Donald Guerrier headed over, before being replaced in the 72nd minute.As group winners, Arsenal will avoid the four best-placed teams teams dropping down from the Champions League in the draw for the last 32, which takes place on Monday at 12:00 GMT.The first legs will be played on 14 February, with the return legs on 21 February. As a seeded team, Arsenal will play their second leg at home.
