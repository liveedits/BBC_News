The Terriers had arrived at Molineux with the worst goal-scoring record in the division - having mustered just six goals from their opening 12 games - but Mooy swept them into an early lead with a placed effort from Erik Durm's cut-back.The Australia midfielder then secured the points for the visitors in the second period with a curling free-kick to beat home goalkeeper Rui Patricio at his near post.
    
        
Wolves, who looked out of sorts during the first half, did threaten to equalise after the break.  However, goal-line technology showed that a Raul Jimenez header was cleared by Huddersfield midfielder Philip Billing when all but an agonising 1.8cm of the ball had fully crossed the line.The result sees Huddersfield climb to 14th in the table, while Wolves remain in 11th.More to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsWolves11Rui Patrício5Bennett16Coady15Boly2Doherty28João MoutinhoSubstituted forGibbs-Whiteat 45'minutes8NevesBooked at 87mins29Vinagre10Hélder CostaSubstituted forJotaat 75'minutes9Jiménez7CavaleiroSubstituted forTraoréat 45'minutesSubstitutes17Gibbs-White18Jota21Ruddy27Saïss32Dendoncker33Bonatini37TraoréHuddersfield1Lössl2SmithBooked at 17mins26Schindler5Kongolo33Hadergjonaj10Mooy6HoggBooked at 60minsSubstituted forStankovicat 90+3'minutes8BillingSubstituted forWilliamsat 90+3'minutes37Durm21PritchardSubstituted forMbenzaat 90+3'minutes24MounieSubstitutes9Kachunga12Hamer14Sobhi18Mbenza19Williams20Depoitre27StankovicReferee:Kevin FriendAttendance:30,130Match StatsHome TeamWolvesAway TeamHuddersfieldPossessionHome45%Away55%ShotsHome12Away14Shots on TargetHome3Away6CornersHome3Away5FoulsHome9Away8Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Wolverhampton Wanderers 0, Huddersfield Town 2.Full TimePosted at 90'+5' Second Half ends, Wolverhampton Wanderers 0, Huddersfield Town 2.Posted at 90'+5' Attempt missed.
