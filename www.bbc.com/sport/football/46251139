"My job is easy: I have to find out why. We know that happiness doesn't last forever but this is how you show your character, bouncing back from these moments."It was probably one of the worst performances we have had. We have to take a good look, find out why and prepare better."The Terriers had arrived at Molineux with the worst scoring record in the division - mustering just six goals from their opening 12 games - but Mooy's first goal of the campaign delivered an early lead as he placed his effort from Erik Durm's cut-back.The Australia midfielder then secured the points for the visitors in the second period with a curling free-kick, beating home goalkeeper Rui Patricio at his near post."It lifts the confidence and their mood," Huddersfield boss Wagner said. "Away wins are always very important in the Premier League and now we have the first one we have to try and surf on this wave we have created."The players have shown better performances - or at least comparable performances - this season but they have not got the rewards."Wolves, who toiled during the first half, briefly threatened to equalise after the break. However, goal-line technology showed that a Raul Jimenez header had just been cleared in time by Huddersfield midfielder Philip Billing - with all but an agonising 1.8cm of the ball crossing the line.The result sees Huddersfield climb to 14th in the table, while Wolves remain in 11th.Huddersfield spark into lifeAfter a dismal start of 10 games without a victory to their second season in the Premier League, Wagner's Huddersfield side appear to have now sparked into life.This win is their second in three matches, in a period when they have collected seven points from a possible nine.Wagner took his side to Marbella in the south of Spain during the international break and at times there was a sunshine feel to their football in the West Midlands. Mooy's opening goal was reward for a wonderful move down the left involving Billing and Durm, and their slick passing allowed them to establish an early rhythm that the hosts struggled to contain.The only complaint was that Huddersfield did not confirm their superiority earlier than Mooy's second goal.Terence Kongolo spurned a chance after a perfectly executed, pre-planned corner routine, and Patricio also saved a Steve Mounie header that was directed straight at him.Alex Pritchard twice found himself in excellent shooting positions, and was denied on the second occasion by Wolves' Portugal goalkeeper after a glorious interchange between Mooy and Billing on the right.Mooy's coup de grace, from 20 yards out, was no more than they deserved and it ensured they are unbeaten in three matches for the first time this calendar year.Wolves fail to respondSince their promotion to the Premier League Wolves have forged a reputation as a passing team, but also as a second-half team.  Prior to this fixture, 10 of Wanderers' 12 goals had arrived after the interval, allowing Nuno's side to collect four victories from the opening 12 games. That resilience has also contributed to creditable draws against both Manchester clubs, as well as Arsenal in their last Premier League encounter. But this fixture highlighted that their capacity to recover is far from guaranteed in the top flight. Having been hindered by a series of errant passes, a half-time revision of tactics and the introduction of Morgan Gibbs-White and Adama Traore did allow Wolves to build some momentum after the break. 
                    
                        
                
                Goal-line technology showed Raul Jimenez's header was cleared by Huddersfield midfielder Philip Billing with all but 1.8cm of the ball over the line.And had Jimenez's header from Traore's cross travelled just 18mm further it may have laid the platform for a grandstand finish.But in the aftermath of that nearest of near-misses, the impetus was lost and as Wolves' control of possession started to drift, the visitors regained their composure and extended their lead.Man of the match - Philip Billing (Huddersfield Town)
