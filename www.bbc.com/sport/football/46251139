The Terriers had arrived at Molineux with the worst goal-scoring record in the division - having mustered just six goals from their opening 12 games - but Mooy's first goal of the campaign gave them an early lead as he placed his effort from Erik Durm's cut-back.The Australia midfielder then secured the points for the visitors in the second period with a curling free-kick, beating home goalkeeper Rui Patricio at his near post.
    
        
Wolves, who looked out of sorts during the first half, did threaten to equalise after the break.  However, goal-line technology showed that a Raul Jimenez header had just been cleared in time by Huddersfield midfielder Philip Billing - all but an agonising 1.8cm of the ball had crossed the line.The result sees Huddersfield climb to 14th in the table, while Wolves remain in 11th.Huddersfield spark into lifeAfter a dismal start of 10 games without a victory to their second season in the Premier League, David Wagner's Huddersfield side appear to have now sparked into life.This win is their second in three matches, in a period when they have collected seven points from a possible nine on offer.Wagner took his side to Marbella in the south of Spain during the international break and at times there was a sunshine feel to their football in the West Midlands. Mooy's opening goal was reward for a wonderful move down the left involving Billing and Durm, and their slick passing allowed them to establish an early rhythm that the hosts struggled to contain.The only complaint was that Huddersfield did not confirm their superiority earlier than Mooy's second goal.Terence Kongolo spurned a chance after a perfectly executed, pre-planned corner routine, and Patricio also saved a Steve Mounie header that was directed straight at him.Alex Pritchard twice found himself in excellent shooting positions, and was denied on the second occasion by Wolves' Portugal goalkeeper after a glorious interchange between Mooy and Billing on the right.Mooy's coup de grace, from 20 yards out, was no more than they deserved and it ensured they are unbeaten in three matches for the first time this calendar year.Wolves fail to respondSince their promotion to the Premier League Wolves have forged a reputation as a passing team, but also as a second-half team.  Prior to this fixture, 10 of Wanderers' 12 goals had arrived after the interval, allowing Nuno Espirito Santo's side to collect four victories from the opening 12 games. That resilience has also contributed to creditable draws against both Manchester clubs, as well as Arsenal in their last Premier League encounter. But this fixture highlighted that their capacity to recover is far from guaranteed in the top flight. Having been hindered by a series of errant passes, a half-time revision of tactics and the introduction of Morgan Gibbs-White and Adama Traore did allow Wolves to build some momentum after the break.
