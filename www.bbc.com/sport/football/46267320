A number of Championship clubs had pushed for a different deal.They felt that what Sky were offering undervalued the rights for the league and left Championship sides at a disadvantage. EFL interim chair Debbie Jevans said in a statement that she will review how the EFL discusses future deals with clubs as a result of the concerns: "Concluding these negotiations has indeed been challenging, as is the case when managing a diverse group of stakeholders, and the board took on board the comments and frustrations voiced by a number of clubs and has committed to reviewing the way the League engages with its clubs to ensure that we move forward in a collaborative way in the future," she said.More to follow.
