Another sensational Messi set-piece - this time from further out - completed the victory.Sevilla had missed the chance to leapfrog Ernesto Valverde's side earlier on Saturday as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Valencia.That allowed Atletico Madrid, who recorded a comfortable 3-0 victory over fourth-placed Alaves, to briefly move level on points with the top two.Barca, who face Tottenham in the Champions League on Tuesday, also hit the woodwork twice in a one-sided first half, Suarez slicing against the post from Messi's pass before the latter crashed a header against the other post.Espanyol improved after the interval and had a goal disallowed for offside when Oscar Duarte stabbed home Sergio Garcia's cross from close range, but a comeback was never a serious possibility for the hosts.The win cements Barcelona's place at the La Liga summit, while Espanyol drop to ninth after slipping to a fourth consecutive league defeat.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsEspanyol13López16López Rodríguez15López6Duarte12ViláBooked at 79mins17PérezSubstituted forBaptistaoat 59'minutes10DarderSubstituted forGraneroat 74'minutes21Roca4Sánchez14MelendoSubstituted forGarcíaat 63'minutes7IglesiasSubstitutes1Jiménez5Gomes Pereira8Rosales9García11Baptistao19Piatti23GraneroBarcelona1ter Stegen2Nélson Semedo3Piqué15Lenglet18Alba4RakiticSubstituted forD Suárezat 82'minutes5Busquets22Vidal10Messi9SuárezSubstituted forEl Haddadiat 79'minutes11DembéléSubstituted forCoutinhoat 68'minutesSubstitutes6D Suárez7Coutinho13Cillessen19El Haddadi21Aleñá24Vermaelen27MirandaReferee:Carlos del Cerro GrandeAttendance:24,037Match StatsHome TeamEspanyolAway TeamBarcelonaPossessionHome45%Away55%ShotsHome15Away17Shots on TargetHome3Away9CornersHome11Away4FoulsHome16Away10Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Espanyol 0, Barcelona 4.Full TimePosted at 90'+7' Second Half ends, Espanyol 0, Barcelona 4.Posted at 90'+6' Foul by Arturo Vidal (Barcelona).Posted at 90'+6' Sergio García (Espanyol) wins a free kick in the attacking half.Posted at 90'+5' Attempt blocked.
