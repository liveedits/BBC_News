Tottenham had gone behind to Ousmane Dembele's early strike but then peppered Barcelona's defence with wave after wave of attacks, with both Harry Kane and Son Heung-min going close.They finally made the decisive breakthrough five minutes from the end when substitute Moura, who moments earlier had a header cleared off the line, fired in.Spurs become only the eighth side to qualify from the group stage after claiming only one point from their first three games.Reaction to Tuesday's Champions League actionSpurs rewarded for attacking displayIf Spurs had been eliminated then they would have looked back on how they only once managed to beat goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen.The Dutchman, who replaced first-choice Marc-Andre ter Stegen, was exceptional throughout and his clawed save to keep out Moura's earlier effort came after superb stops to deny Son and Christian Eriksen.Kane was also denied by the makeshift Barcelona defence when his header was cleared off the line by Miranda. But, like the rest of his team-mates, Kane persevered and with time running out his pinpoint cross found Moura whose first-time finish sealed Spurs' qualification - an achievement that seemed so improbable just a few weeks ago.More to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsBarcelona13Cillessen2Nélson SemedoBooked at 68mins15Lenglet24Vermaelen27Miranda26Aleñá4RakiticSubstituted forBusquetsat 45'minutes8Ramos de Oliveira Melo11DembéléSubstituted forD Suárezat 76'minutes19El HaddadiSubstituted forMessiat 63'minutes7CoutinhoSubstitutes1ter Stegen3Piqué5Busquets6D Suárez10Messi18Alba22VidalTottenham1Lloris16Walker-PetersBooked at 15minsSubstituted forLamelaat 61'minutes4Alderweireld5Vertonghen3Rose8WinksSubstituted forLlorenteat 83'minutes17Sissoko23Eriksen20Alli10Kane7Son Heung-MinSubstituted forLucas Mouraat 71'minutesSubstitutes11Lamela15Dier18Llorente22Gazzaniga27Lucas Moura33Davies52SkippReferee:Milorad MazicAttendance:69,961Match StatsHome TeamBarcelonaAway TeamTottenhamPossessionHome49%Away51%ShotsHome14Away17Shots on TargetHome3Away7CornersHome2Away5FoulsHome9Away19Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Barcelona 1, Tottenham Hotspur 1.Full TimePosted at 90'+5' Second Half ends, Barcelona 1, Tottenham Hotspur 1.Posted at 90'+4' Foul by Danny Rose (Tottenham Hotspur).Posted at 90'+4' Nélson Semedo (Barcelona) wins a free kick in the defensive half.Posted at 90'+2' Attempt missed.
