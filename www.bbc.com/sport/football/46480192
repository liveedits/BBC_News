"We are all wishing Jordan a speedy recovery," said Lionesses head coach Phil Neville."She is an invaluable member of the Lionesses squad and played a huge part in helping us secure our place at next summer's Women's World Cup finals in France.  "Naturally we are disappointed that a player of Jordan's ability and importance will not be able to take part in the World Cup, but the priority is that she returns to full fitness and can look forward to many exciting years ahead playing for both her club and country." Phil Neville's Lionesses will go into the World Cup as one of the favourites, having finished third in 2015 in Canada.Nobbs did not play in that tournament because of a hamstring injury, but was part of the squad.
