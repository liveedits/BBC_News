Klopp has been fined Â£8,000 by the Football Association and warned about his future behaviour.One for the ages or 'absolutely shocking' behaviour?Emotion behind Klopp reaction - GuardiolaThe German had already apologised for the incident and has now stressed it will "not happen again"."If you break the rules you have to be fined for it," he added."If there was no rule then managers would constantly celebrate on the pitch. I don't think anyone thought it was massively wrong."The last time I did that was about 14 years ago. I'm not as quick now."

                Liverpool 1-0 Everton: Klopp apologises for running on pitch after winnerSpeaking after Sunday's game, which Liverpool won 1-0 to move two points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City, the German had said: "I have to apologise because I didn't want to be disrespectful - but I couldn't stop myself."If I could describe how I felt when the goal went in, then I would have control over it. We don't want to look for excuses but that's how it is."The plan was not to run. When I chose to stop, I was close to Alisson. He was surprised."Everton counterpart Marco Silva said he had no issue with Klopp's actions."It's the emotion of the game. It's a normal situation - he's celebrating," Silva said."If you ask me, I think he shouldn't [have been fined] but the FA has to decide what the rules are."Players celebrating with the fans, some of them taking their shirts off, Klopp or myself or the others celebrating with the fans or with one player, I think it's part of the game and is something you can't stop."It's really important as well, even if sometimes you get fined, this passion in the game."BBC Radio 5 live summariser Robbie Savage said he had "never seen anything like it", while former England defender Danny Mills said it was "absolutely shocking".Arsenal & Tottenham charged after derby melee
