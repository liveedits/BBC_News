                Hughes is under pressure after winning just three of his 21 Premier League games in charge of SouthamptonAfter a deflating weekend defeat by Fulham sent the visitors into the Premier League relegation zone, there has been fresh speculation over the future of Southampton manager Mark Hughes.The Welshman picked a strong line-up for this match and, in turn, they delivered a performance, if not victory.After a first half that lacked rhythm or pace, the Saints created the clearer chances in the second half.None was better than the one that Michael Obafemi missed. The 18-year-old striker, making his first Southampton start, contrived to slice wide from close range under little pressure.Before missing the crucial penalty, Gabbiadini was very nearly the match-winner. The Italian's injury-time free-kick seemed destined for the back of the net, only to be diverted onto the woodwork by a sprawling Ward.Hughes will hope to take some of that attacking purpose into the Premier League meeting with his former club Manchester United on Saturday.Leicester strength in depth pays
