I was about to come on against Southampton in the League Cup final, and in those moments it was embarrassing."It was getting to a point where I was embarrassed. I thought 'I can't keep doing this', as hard as it was to leave United."In the Southampton game, [manager Jose] Mourinho came to me and said: 'I want you to lift the trophy.' I was like: 'Well, I didn't even play in the game.'"He was persistent with it, and I literally lifted it and moved it on. What was I doing? I need to move on and go somewhere else."How do other countries say goodbye to legends?Kane will break my record, says Rooney after 'special night' at WembleyEngland sweep aside US 3-0
