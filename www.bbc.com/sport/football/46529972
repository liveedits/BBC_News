Carlos Soler pounced on Jones' headed clearance to strike home a fizzing low finish amid slack marking for Valencia's opener.And Jones was badly at fault for the second after the break as he diverted a through ball past Sergio Romero from outside his own box, when the United keeper had left his line to claim the ball. That disastrous error followed a remarkable miss by Pogba in the first half, when the France midfielder somehow stabbed wide from four yards out after Marouane Fellaini's knockdown at a corner. Three second-half substitutes combined to earn a late consolation, as Marcus Rashford headed home Ashley Young's cross after Jesse Lingard kept the ball in play. Juan Mata then almost grabbed an equaliser as he fired a volley wide from inside the box after Pogba's smart chip over the defence.But defeat means United will play a group winner in the knockout stage, one of Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund, Paris St-Germain, Porto, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.Had United finished top, they would have played one of Atletico Madrid, Roma, Schalke, Ajax and Lyon.Relive Wednesday's Champions League actionMore to follow.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsValencia1Doménech21Piccini3Nunes Vezo12Diakhaby15Latorre GruesoBooked at 28minsSubstituted forGarayat 51'minutes8Soler10Parejo6Kondogbia11CheryshevSubstituted forTorresat 66'minutes23Batshuayi22Mina LorenzoSubstituted forRodrigoat 68'minutesSubstitutes13Murara Neto17Coquelin18Wass19Rodrigo20Torres24Garay34LeeMan Utd22Romero25A ValenciaBooked at 11mins3BaillyBooked at 30mins4Jones16RojoSubstituted forYoungat 45'minutes17FredSubstituted forRashfordat 57'minutesBooked at 81mins27Fellaini6Pogba8Mata9LukakuSubstituted forLingardat 69'minutes15PereiraSubstitutes10Rashford13Grant14Lingard18Young21Herrera37Garner54GreenwoodReferee:Georgi KabakovMatch StatsHome TeamValenciaAway TeamMan UtdPossessionHome45%Away55%ShotsHome11Away12Shots on TargetHome3Away5CornersHome5Away5FoulsHome6Away23Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Valencia 2, Manchester United 1.Full TimePosted at 90'+4' Second Half ends, Valencia 2, Manchester United 1.Posted at 90'+2' Offside, Manchester United.
