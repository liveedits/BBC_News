The result sees Germany drop into pot two before the draw on 2 December.Germany could therefore be drawn in the same qualifying group for Euro 2020 as England or World Cup finalists France and Croatia, who are among the teams in pot one.Nations League Group A3 winners Portugal started brightly in Guimaraes and went in front when Silva met Renato Sanches's corner at the near post in the 33rd minute.Having gone behind, Poland burst into life and Tomasz Kedziora's header struck the crossbar.Portugal were reduced to 10 men when Danilo Pereira hauled down Milik inside the penalty area after the Portuguese lost possession in a dangerous area.Milik stepped up to beat Beto from the spot but the referee ordered a retake because of encroachment. The Napoli striker held his nerve and went the same way to send the topless supporters in the away end into raptures. Poland had chances to secure all three points, but they leave Portugal having secured their top-10 status on goal difference.Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsPortugal22Beto2Cavaco Cancelo3Pepe18Rúben Dias19Rodrigues8Renato Sanches13DaniloBooked at 63mins14William Carvalho15Ferreira SilvaSubstituted forTué Na Bangnaat 70'minutes23André SilvaBooked at 64minsSubstituted forMacedo Lopesat 87'minutes5GuerreiroSubstituted forJoão Márioat 61'minutesBooked at 90minsSubstitutes1Rui Patrício4Novo Neto6José Fonte7Tué Na Bangna9Macedo Lopes10João Mário12Morais Ramos16Bruno Fernandes17Gonçalo Guedes20Afonso Fernandes21Cédric SoaresPoland1Szczesny15Kedziora4CionekBooked at 11mins5BednarekBooked at 28mins18Bereszynski8KlichSubstituted forGóralskiat 75'minutes10Krychowiak11GrosickiSubstituted forKadziorat 79'minutes20ZielinskiSubstituted forSzymanskiat 90+5'minutes21FrankowskiBooked at 78mins7MilikSubstitutes2Pietrzak3Matynia6Góralski9Piatek12Skorupski13Buksa14Olkowski16Blaszczykowski17Kadzior19Kaminski22Fabianski23SzymanskiReferee:Sergey KarasevAttendance:29,917Match StatsHome TeamPortugalAway TeamPolandPossessionHome50%Away50%ShotsHome6Away13Shots on TargetHome1Away3CornersHome5Away5FoulsHome11Away13Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Portugal 1, Poland 1.Full TimePosted at 90'+5' Second Half ends, Portugal 1, Poland 1.SubstitutionPosted at 90'+5' Substitution, Poland.
