Head and Shaun Marsh added 84, but Hanuma Vihari and Ishant Sharma picked up their second wickets before stumps.Captain Tim Paine is unbeaten on 16, with Pat Cummins (11 not out) also at the crease at the close.Australia had won the toss and in fierce heat, on a green-tinged Perth Stadium pitch, opted to bat.India's seam-heavy attack restricted the scoring early on, but could not force a breakthrough until a full delivery from Bumrah removed Finch after lunch.Usman Khawaja stuttered, scoring only five runs off 38 balls, before a frustrated cut shot off Umesh Yadav accounted for his wicket.Harris edged a rising Vihari delivery to fall on 70 before a superb stretching catch from Virat Kohli off Sharma removed Peter Handscomb for just seven.Australia, having lost four wickets for just 36 runs, looked vulnerable but Head and Marsh carefully guided them to safer ground.However, Marsh (45) and Head (58) fell in the final session to leave the match, like the series so far, delicately poised.The Test is the first at the ground after a 47-year run at the Waca.
