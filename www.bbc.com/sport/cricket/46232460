England lead the three-Test series 1-0.Opener Rory Burns scored his maiden Test fifty, putting on 73 with Keaton Jennings (26) in the morning after nightwatchman Jack Leach was dismissed early on.Sri Lanka hit back to reduce England to 109-4 but Root, Buttler (34) and Foakes built an imposing target in Pallekele, despite the pitch perhaps not being as difficult to bat on as first thought.Although seven of England's nine wickets came from sweep or reverse sweep shots, their attacking approach flustered the hosts and has taken the tourists a step closer to a first series win in Sri Lanka since 2001.More to follow.
