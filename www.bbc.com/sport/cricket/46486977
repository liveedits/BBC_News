Stokes was cleared of affray in August.Hales did not face criminal charges.Stokes, 27, missed five months of England games, including the Ashes, after the incident in September 2017.During that time, batsman Hales, who is not part of the Test side, effectively only missed two one-day internationals.Hales played limited-overs cricket for England in January, while Stokes, who was made unavailable for the tour of Australia, returned for England's trip to New Zealand that followed.Both men have been consistently involved in the England team since, though Stokes did miss the second Test against India while he stood trial.More to follow.
