Nightwatchman Jack Leach played out the last over as England closed on 0-0.Sri Lanka v England - reaction & analysisThe tourists were awarded five penalty runs during Sri Lanka's innings after Roshen deliberately ran short. The runs were added to their first-innings total of 285.On a testing pitch that is still producing sharp turn, England will have to bat with the concentration and determination Sri Lanka showed to post a challenging fourth-innings target.England lead the three-match series 1-0 and are looking for their first away series win under captain Joe Root.Superb Sri Lanka grab leadWith Sri Lanka six down and trailing by more than 100 runs, England were on top and would have been hopeful of securing a substantial lead, but the hosts' lower order fought back superbly.After just about surviving Adil Rashid's testing post-lunch spell, Roshen calmly played with the spin to keep the scoreboard ticking along and received stoic support in compiling stands of 46, 41, 56 and 28 for the last four wickets.Niroshan Dickwella emulated Jos Buttler's approach on day one, using sweeps and reverse sweeps to knock the spinners off their length to make 25 before sweeping over a full Joe Root delivery that skidded into his pads.Once Leach trapped Dilruwan Perera lbw for 15, Roshen opened up. He hit Moeen Ali down the ground for six and punished an increasingly ragged England alongside Akila Dananjaya, who made a fluent 31 off 39 balls before falling lbw to Moeen.Added to Karunaratne and Dhananjaya's patient partnership of 96 in the morning, this was comfortably Sri Lanka's best day of the series.England did not bowl particularly badly but their spinners were inconsistent, producing too many bad balls between the unplayable ones and allowing the hosts to alleviate the pressure.More to follow.
