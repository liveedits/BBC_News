England closed on 3-0, leading by 99 runs.Dimuth Karunaratne hit 83 and Dhananjaya de Silva made 73 in a stand of 142 to put Sri Lanka on top approaching the tea interval.But Dhananjaya's dismissal gave England an opening and they ruthlessly ran through the rest of the order to take a step closer to winning every Test in a series in Sri Lanka for the first time.The tourists have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.Reaction & analysis to day twoRashid and Stokes scramble Sri LankaRashid bowled just one over before lunch and returned to the attack with Sri Lanka coasting on 148-1 to begin a wonderful, match-turning spell of 5-43 in 12.5 overs.His first wicket was a somewhat innocuous delivery that Dhananjaya tried to push away square, only to pick out Jennings at short leg.But, especially after tea, Rashid then bowled with real verve, finding a heady mix of dip, turn and bounce to force Sri Lanka's batsmen into playing him tentatively and bringing the close fielders into play.The leg-spinner got one to lift at Karunaratne, who edged it into his pad which sent the ball looping up to give Jennings the easiest of catches, before a brilliant googly deceived Roshen Silva into an inside edge that Jennings grabbed one-handed with aplomb.He then had Kusal Mendis prodding a late cut to Stokes at first slip before finishing off Sri Lanka's tail by removing last man Malinda Pushpakumara lbw for 13.Stokes provided excellent support from the other end, extracting pace and bounce from the best batting pitch of the series and baffling the batsmen by varying his length.All three of his wickets were caught behind. Foakes took a superb low effort after initially moving the wrong way when Angelo Mathews miscued a pull shot off the toe end, before Niroshan Dickwella glanced one down leg and Dilruwan Perera fended loosely at a ball angled across him.More to follow.
