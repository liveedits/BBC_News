England lead the three-Test series 1-0.Sri Lanka fought back admirably after Jack Leach took three early wickets as England's spinners struggled to apply consistent pressure.But Moeen Ali's lbw dismissal of Mathews should mean England wrap up victory on Sunday to claim their first series win in Sri Lanka since 2001 and their first away from home under captain Joe Root.No further play was possible once heavy rain set in shortly after 10:00 GMT. The final day will start 15 minutes earlier than scheduled at 04:15.Mature Mathews falls short of centuryArriving at the crease Sri Lanka in the mire, Mathews played an innings of remarkable application and maturity, not least when you consider his recent torrid spell in international cricket and tumultuous relationship with the Sri Lankan board.He stepped down as captain in all three formats after defeat by Zimbabwe in a one-day series last year, returned as skipper in January, and was sacked in September.Day later, he was dropped from the ODI squad to face England, with selectors critical of his fitness and running between the wickets.Here he patiently worked the ball into the gaps, accumulating calmly as he hit only three fours in reaching his third half-century of the series off 75 balls.He added 77 with Dimuth Karunaratne (57) and 73 with Roshen Silva (27) before playing more expansively once joined by the attacking Niroshan Dickwella to put England under serious pressure.But, just as in both innings in the first Test at Galle, the tea interval proved to be Mathews' undoing. He missed a ball that Moeen got to straighten from around the wicket, with the lbw decision confirmed on review.More to follow.
