England are the reigning 50-over champions, beating India in the final.In order to be the undisputed white-ball team in the world, England will need to beat in-form Australia, who cruised to the final following a 71-run victory over hosts and defending champions West Indies.Knight, 27, who led her team to a comfortable eight-wicket win over India for a spot in the final, expects a "really good and tight" game against Australia.England's World Cup win: The transformation of women's cricketShe said: "You can't really ignore that it's the old enemy, can you? It's probably the two best teams in the world historically over the last few years, and we've had some amazing games of cricket recently. "We had the Ashes series we drew out in Australia and a really good T20 series out there for us, where we won 2-1, and the game to finish off the series was a real thriller. "It's a real achievement [making the final], especially considering the inexperience we've brought to this tournament, and the girls are massively excited."The final starts at midnight UK time on Saturday night/Sunday morning, as Australia chase their fourth World T20 title.
