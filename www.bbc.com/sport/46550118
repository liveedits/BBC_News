It follows political pressure about the amount of betting advertising on TV.No betting adverts will now be shown during live sport coverage before 21:00 in the UK from five minutes before the event begins until five minutes after it finishes, excluding horse racing and greyhound racing broadcasts. It is understood the ban would include events that begin before the watershed but end after it."We believe that this is itself a watershed moment as we strive to provide the ever safer gambling environment which gambling consumers and the wider public expect, and which is so important to the future success and sustainability of our industry," IGRG chair John Hagan said. "Today the gambling industry is responding positively to public concerns about the amount of gambling advertising on television before the watershed."BBC Three: Does football have a gambling problem?5 live Investigates: Betting links found on football clubs' junior fan pagesWhy are sports betting adverts 'dangerous'?What has the reaction been?Jeremy Wright, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, said the ban is a "welcome move".He added: "I am pleased that the sector is stepping up and responding to public concerns."It is vital children and vulnerable people are protected from the threat of gambling-related harm. Companies must be socially responsible."In September, Labour called for the introduction of a betting advertising ban during live sporting events and last week deputy leader Tom Watson said he was "delighted" betting companies had agreed the ban.After the move was confirmed on Thursday, he said: "This is an important first step in recognising that the proliferation of gambling adverts has got completely out of hand."It was imperative for the industry to accept there is a problem and they have done that today. "The next step will have to be addressing the gambling adverts that children and vulnerable problem gamblers see online."Gambling Commission chief executive Neil McArthur said: "Today's announcement is a significant step forward in demonstrating that this is an industry that is starting to listen to its customers and the wider public."AnalysisBBC sports news correspondent Richard ConwayThe gambling companies have taken decisive action in voluntarily banning betting adverts before the 21:00 watershed.Is it enough? Many have pointed to the amount the bookies spend with online marketing. Shirt sponsorship of teams, perimeter advertising and putting their name to league and cup competitions will also be unaffected.Nevertheless, the measures restricting TV ads have been welcomed by politicians and the public alike.Perhaps conscious of the way government acted in eventually legislating to reduce the big stakes of fixed odds betting terminals in bookmaker shops, the industry has made the first move.Their hope is that they'll be seen as responsible partners - and stave off present or future governments imposing any restrictive measures upon them.
