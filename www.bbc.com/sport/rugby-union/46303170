Bath's Joe Cokanasiga is on the wing in place of the injured Jack Nowell.Number eight Nathan Hughes, whose six-week ban for punching ended this week, is on the bench as coach Eddie Jones opts to recall Sam Underhill and Brad Shields to the starting line-up and persist with Newcastle's Mark Wilson at the back of the pack.Courtney Lawes shifts from the back row into the second row. Jones said he had named a full-strength team to face Australia after an experimental selection stuttered to a 35-15 win over Japan last weekend."We've picked our best 23 for the Australia game. We know they have a unique style of attack so our ability to defend that is going to be important," he said."I'm really happy with the direction we're going in terms of the way we play the game. We are developing a unique style of rugby, which is English and the players are proud to play that way."A succession of injuries and disciplinary issues have restricted Tuilagi to the briefest of cameos during Jones' time in charge, with a groin strain forcing him to drop out of the squad to face South Africa in the first of England's autumn internationals.More to follow.Referees should show more cards to change player behaviour - World Rugby chiefQuiz: Name the World Rugby Player of the Year winnersEngland team to face Australia:Daly; Cokanasiga, Slade, Te'o, May; Farrell, Youngs; Moon, George, Sinckler, Itoje, Lawes, Shields, Underhill, Wilson.Replacements: Hartley, Hepburn, Williams, Ewels, Hughes, Wigglesworth, Ford, Tuilagi
