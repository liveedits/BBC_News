O'Connor and Matt Smith went over to reduce the deficit to two points, but a Sarries penalty ensured an eighth-straight league win this season.The defending champions are still second in the table, level on points with leaders Exeter, but now unbeaten in 19 games in all competitions.Leicester, looking to avoid a fifth successive loss in domestic league and cup competitions, had little to show after making a strong start, as Jonah Holmes - back after making his Wales debut - and Gareth Owen had tries ruled out by the Television Match Official.Saracens dazzled in response, with Max Malins creating the pick of the first-half tries with a defence-defying mazy run and looping pass to send Lewington over.Ben Spencer's 80-metre dash for the game's opening try after charging down a kick and Lozowski's bustling effort on his return from England duty, however, were also fine examples of Sarries' ruthless attacking ability.Despite the margin and costly loss of hooker Tom Youngs to a knee injury before the break, Leicester stubbornly fought their way back into the contest.O'Connor crashed over for Tigers' first try to give them renewed impetus after the break, and their relentless pressure saw Earl and Burger yellow carded.Leicester, who were down 24-10 with 14 minutes remaining, made the numerical advantage count with devastating effect as O'Connor bundled over a second before Smith crossed out wide.Even with Spencer alleviating some of the pressure with his late penalty, Leicester pressed in search of a winning score until the end but ultimately ran out of time.Leicester: Holmes; Thompstone, Owen, Eastmond, J Olowofela; J Ford, Harrison; Bateman, T Youngs (capt), Cole, Spencer, Kitchener, Williams, O'Connor, Kalamafoni.Replacements: Kerr, Gigena, Cortes, Wells, Fitzgerald, White, Hardwick, Worth.Saracens: Goode; Lozowski, Tompkins, Barritt (capt), Lewington; Malins, Spencer; Barrington, Tolofua, Judge, Day, Skelton, Rhodes, Burger, Wray.Replacements: Woolstencroft, Thompson-Stringer, Sasagi, Kpoku, Clark, Earl, Whiteley, Gallagher.Referee: Karl Dickson.
