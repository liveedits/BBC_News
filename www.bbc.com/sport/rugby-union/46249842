The Grand Slam champions added to their historic first win over the All Blacks in 2016 as they fired out a warning before next year's Rugby World Cup.Stockdale's try pushed his side into a 10-point lead in the 49th minute and the home side produced an heroic defensive display led by man-of-the-match Peter O'Mahony in the closing minutes to repel the inevitable New Zealand fight back as 'The Fields of Athenry' rang through the Dublin night.Stockdale swings itA game of tiny margins was ultimately decided by a moment of brilliance by Stockdale which had Joe Schmidt's imprint all over it.Off a 10 metre line-out - Ireland's favourite attacking platform - the home side swung the ball towards the right before Bundee Aki dramatically switched direction and fed Stockdale down the narrow side.It left last season's Six Nations player of the year facing a group of weary All Blacks who were still picking themselves up from the line-out.The Ulster wing's deft chip took them out of play and he won the sprint with Aaron Smith to re-gather and score the decisive try.More to follow.Ireland: Kearney; Earls, Ringrose, Aki, Stockdale; Sexton, Marmion; Healy, Best (capt), Furlong; Toner, James Ryan; O'Mahony, Van der Flier, Stander.Replacements: Cronin, J McGrath, Porter, Henderson, Murphy, L McGrath, Carbery, Larmour.New Zealand: McKenzie; Smith, Goodhue, Crotty, Ioane; Barrett, Smith; Tu'inukuafe, Taylor, Franks; Whitelock, Retallick: Squire, Savea, Read (capt).Replacements: Dane Coles, Ofa Tuungafasi, Nepo Laulala, Scott Barrett, Matt Todd, TJ Perenara, Richie Mo'unga, Anton Lienert-Brown.
