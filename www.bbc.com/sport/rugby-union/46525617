Wasps4013European Champions Cup standingsToulouse 42-27 WaspsSexton pulls the stringsLeinster will be delighted that World Rugby player of the year Johnny Sexton signed a new contract earlier this week after he was instrumental at fly-half yet again.The Ireland playmaker suffered a calf injury during last weekend's return fixture at Bath, but put on a fine show for his national head coach Joe Schmidt and his successor Andy Farrell in the Aviva crowd.A well-judged cross-field kick from Sexton helped Lowe up to the 22 in the build-up to a move that eventually led to Conan's try.Then a quick switch between the fly-half and centre Garry Ringrose sent winger Jordan Larmour through, helping O'Loughlin to score on his first European start for almost two years.The bonus point came for Leinster after another perfectly weighted kick from Sexton found Byrne with plenty of space to dot down on the right wing.Leavy barrelled over in the second half and Sexton converted, making it five kicks from five in the game before leaving the field in the 61st minute. What they saidMan-of-the-match Leinster centre Rory O'Loughlin said:"We planned to show more intent and we worked hard off the ball to create the extra man in attack."I knew I'd have to put in a performance if I wanted to get a chance. The competition is so high that you have to be on your A game when you get an opportunity."We were disappointed that we let the game get away from us at Toulouse [in round two] and we've played catch up ever since so that's going to be a crucial game against them in the next round of matches."Bath director of rugby Todd Blackadder said:"We didn't make the tackles, there are no excuses for that and that's often the difference in these massive games."These games highlight your strengths and weaknesses. We'll reassess and come up with a plan for the last two pool matches."
