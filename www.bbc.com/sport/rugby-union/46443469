Don Armand's early score was cancelled out by a Willi Heinz try before a Danny Cipriani penalty late in the first half.   Nic White darted over in the opening minute to put the Chiefs ahead, but a second Cirpriani penalty edged Gloucester in front.    
    
        
Jaco Visagie's try put Gloucester out of sight before Ben Morgan polished off the win before a late Tom Lawday try for Exeter.   The result means Gloucester lead Pool 2 by a point before Munster's match against Castres in Limerick on Sunday - whichever side wins that encounter will move to the summit of the group at the midway point.   Exeter looked a shadow of the side that has dominated the Premiership this season as an error-strewn performance means they need to win all their remaining games - which include trips to Ireland and Gloucester - and hope other results go their way.
