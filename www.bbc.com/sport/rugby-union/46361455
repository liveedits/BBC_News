But Sarries also claimed the game's only tries, from hooker Jamie George and Nick Isiekwe's interception try.Wasps have had a poor run of late, having only ended their seven-game losing run in all competitions with last weekend's nervy 32-28 home win over Bristol.But, in the first meeting of these two famous old clubs since Sarries' record-breaking 57-33 Premiership semi-final win in May, the visitors battled well.The first half was a kicking contest, as Sarries' England centre Lozowski landed his first three penalties, while Wasps captain Elliot Daly slotted a 56-metre kick in response.A further two Lozowski penalties and another long-ranger from England star Daly followed after the break, but Sarries, who had to deal with loss of injured Wales star Liam Williams before kick-off, also crucially grabbed two tries.With 20 minutes left, England hooker Jamie George, a hat-trick hero in this same fixture last season, again got over out wide, Lozowski adding the extras.Then, when Daly's pass was intercepted close to the try-line eight minutes from time, Isiekwe was on hand to crash over.Saracens: Gallagher; Maitland, Lozowski, Barritt (capt), Lewington; Goode, Wigglesworth; Lamositele, George, Koch, Itoje, Skelton, Rhodes, Clark, Wray.Replacements: Adams-Hale for Lamositele (55), Figallo for Koch (55), Isiekwe for Skelton (55), Earl for Clark (62).
