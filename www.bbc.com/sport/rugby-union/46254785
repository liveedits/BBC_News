But tries from Kelly Smith and Abbie Scott stretched the lead before Courtney Holtkamp's late consolation.Coach Simon Middleton made 10 changes to the England side that had swept the USA aside 57-5 nine days earlier, with flanker Marlie Packer returning to the starting XV a week after pleading guilty to drink driving. England's three first-half tries all showcased the side's prowess in the rolling maul, with Worcester Valkyries hooker Davies forcing her way over twice in 10 minutes before flanker Cleall, one of five Saracens players in the starting line-up, bundled over in similar fashion.But with Lucy Attwood missing all three conversion attempts, Canada narrowed the deficit with a converted try in stoppage time when centre Tessier collected a deft chip from fly-half Anais Holly over the try line to touch down.England camped in Canada's half for much of the second half but conceded against the run of play when Alarie intercepted a pass just in front of her own try line. Canada's captain raced downfield and just evaded England winger Smith to touch down in the corner for a try that Brianna Miller failed to convert.But Smith showed no signs of her long chase when showing great strength to go over for England's fourth try, collecting a fine pass from Rachael Burford to go over just inside the corner.Scott put the result beyond any doubt with a try reminiscent of the first half when the lock, helped by impressive substitute Zoe Alcroft, charged over under the posts but Canada lock Holtkamp gave the visitors a deserved consolation from close range in stoppage time.England women: McKenna (Saracens), Wood (Gloucester-Hartpury), Attwood (Bristol Bears), Burford (Harlequins), Smith (Gloucester-Hartpury), Harrison (Saracens), Riley (Harlequins); Cornborough (Harlequins), Davies (Worcester Valkyries), Botterman (Saracens), O'Donnell (Loughborough Lightning), Scott (Harlequins), Cleall (Saracens), Packer (Saracens) Hunter (Loughborough Lightning)Replacements: Kerr (Darlington Mowden Park Sharks), Perry (Saracens), Brown (Harlequins), Aldcroft (Gloucester-Hartpury), Brown (Loughborough Lightning),  Macdonald (Wasps FC Ladies),  Daley-Mclean, (Loughborough Lightning), Williams (Loughborough Lightning)Canada: Alarie, Harvey, Thibault, Tessier, Poulin, Holly, Miller; DeMerchant, Russell, Menin, Beukeboom, Holtkamp, Senft, Slevinsky, Nelles.Replacements: Carson, Harrigan, Laliberte, Fuamba, Svoboda, Josephson, Black, Patrinos
