Blair Kinghorn replaces Tommy Seymour on the wing."We've been conscious of rotating the squad to enable as many players as possible to be in the best physical condition for each contest," said Townsend."We are expecting those selected this weekend to bring energy and huge effort to the game and seize the opportunity to perform at their best level against a very good team. "It will be another huge challenge, not only for our forward pack, but also for our defence - as Argentina play ambitious, skilful and effective attacking rugby."More to follow.
