Do they need another fresh set of ideas? "My heart says no, I'd love it if Joe stays but you can understand from his own growth and perspective if he wants to move on."Full-back Tremouliere scored five tries in France's Grand Slam-winning Six Nations campaign.She was one of four French players to be nominated for the women's award alongside New Zealand skipper Fiao'o Fa'amausili.
