Williams is the only change from the side that ended a 10-year losing run against the Wallabies on 10 November.Wales, on a three-match winning run against South Africa, are bidding for an autumn clean sweep and a ninth consecutive win in Test matches.Halfpenny has failed to recover from a head injury suffered in a challenge by Australia's Samu Kerevi, an incident Gatland called "reckless".Wales to wear rainbow laces in support of Gareth ThomasHalfpenny ruled out of Springboks TestWales will be our toughest Test - ErasmusAnscombe has held off the challenge of Dan Biggar, who is named on the bench, with the Cardiff Blues man likely to take over the goal-kicking responsibilities in Halfpenny's absence."We have rewarded the team that faced Australia," said Gatland. "Leigh misses out with concussion but it's a great opportunity for Liam at full-back where he hasn't had a lot of time at full-back in the last year."We're giving him a chance without making too many changes. "It's tough, players are disappointed not to be involved. "It's a catch 22 situation, you reward a player who's done well and taken his chance, but then you get the knock on the door from players who want to know why they have been dropped."Gatland says Wales are also hoping for a first autumn clean sweep."It is always nice to achieve milestones," said Gatland."The players are fully aware of what they've achieved and they can do something special."Momentum would be created for the Six Nations and they can continue to build towards the World Cup. "I haven't seen this level of maturity in a group of players. We're calm and our composure in games has been outstanding."We want to end the campaign with a big performance against a very good South African side. It's the end of a campaign, like a cup game. Winner takes all."Wales: L Williams (Saracens); North (Ospreys), J Davies (Scarlets), Parkes (Scarlets), Adams (Worcester); Anscombe (Cardiff Blues), G Davies (Scarlets); Smith (Ospreys), Owens (Scarlets), Francis (Exeter), Beard (Ospreys), Jones (Ospreys, capt), Lydiate (Ospreys), Tipuric (Ospreys), Moriarty (Dragons).Replacements: Dee (Dragons), Evans (Scarlets), Lewis (Cardiff Blues), Hill (Dragons), Jenkins (Cardiff Blues), T Williams (Cardiff Blues), Biggar (Northampton), Watkin (Ospreys).Referee: Luke Pearce (England)Assistants: Wayne Barnes (England), Karl Dickson (England)TMO: Simon McDowell (Ireland)
