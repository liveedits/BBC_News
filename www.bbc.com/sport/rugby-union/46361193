A penalty and Joe Marchant try gave the hosts a buffer before Ian Whitten's runaway score set up a tense finale.The bonus-point victory lifts Paul Gustard's side up to fourth, while Exeter emerged with two points to stay top before Saracens' game against Wasps on Saturday.It is the first time Rob Baxter's side have lost to Harlequins in eight meetings and comes after they had started the Premiership season with eight consecutive wins.The home side had prop Kyle Sinckler back from international duty, while his England team-mate Mike Brown put through an inch-perfect grubber kick for Earle to touch down for a second time.Exeter - without injured wing Jack Nowell - led for 15 minutes in the first half after Matt Kvesic crossed from a signature driving maul, and ensured they would not leave empty-handed when Whitten intercepted a loose Marcus Smith pass to run in.Harlequins: Brown; Ibitoye, Marchant, Saili, Earle; Lang, Care; Marler, Ward, Sinckler, Glynn, Merrick, Dombrandt, Clifford, Chisholm (capt).Replacements: Crumpton, Boyce, Swainston, Luamanu, Kunatani, Mulchrone, Smith, Murley.Exeter: Dollman; O'Flaherty, Whitten, Hill, Cuthbert; Simmonds, White; Low, Yeandle (capt), Holmes, Lees, Dennis, Ewers, Armand, Kvesic.Replacements: Taione, Keast, Street, Atkins, Lawday, Maunder, Steenson, Devoto.
