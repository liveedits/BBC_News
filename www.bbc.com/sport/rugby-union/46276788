Gatland's side have beaten Scotland, Australia and Tonga in November."Leigh is out. He did some training on Saturday morning and he was still feeling a little bit light-headed," said assistant coach Rob Howley."It is a common sense approach. The player's welfare came first so unfortunately he will miss out this weekend."I am glad to say George North is back in full training. He trained this morning and he is available for selection."Wales have won their past three meetings with the Springboks and will name their team for the match at midday on Thursday.More to follow.
