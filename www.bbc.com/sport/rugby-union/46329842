"I feel that Irish rugby is in good hands," said Schmidt."The management and players have been incredible to work with and the tremendous support we have had, particularly at home in the Aviva, but where ever we have travelled, has been uplifting."Farrell, 43, joined the Ireland set-up in April 2016 as defence coach, having previously had a four-year spell as England assistant coach.The father of current England international Owen Farrell, he was a dual code player who England caps after switching from rugby league to union.   Before his role as assistant with England, Farrell coached Aviva Premiership side Saracens. He was also a defence coach for the 2013 Series-winning British & Irish Lions tour to Australia."It is a privilege to be considered for such a prestigious role," he said."I have learned a lot from Joe over the past few seasons and I will continue to learn from him over the next year as the coaching group and players focus on competing in two huge tournaments in 2019."
