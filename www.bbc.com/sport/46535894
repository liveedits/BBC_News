Wiggins has left the Team Sky set-up to establish his own team after retiring as a rider, but Froome and Thomas are still part of its roster, with reigning Tour champion Thomas signing a new three-year deal with Team Sky in September.
                    
                        
                
                
            AnalysisBBC Sport editor Dan RoanThis marks the beginning of the end of an era of success and scandal. Thanks to unmatched levels of financial support from their main backer, Team Sky have come to dominate their sport in recent years. But as well as being arguably the most successful current professional team in British sport, they are also the most controversial. Sky sources tell me that the decision - taken by chief executive Jeremy Darroch - was partly influenced by the £30bn takeover of the satellite broadcaster by media giant Comcast.All commercial partnerships have been under review - and they insist it was not to do with the string of high-profile controversies that so damaged the team's reputation in recent years. But it is only a few months since a scathing report by a parliamentary committee concluded that Team Sky had "crossed the ethical line" over its use of medical exemptions for banned drugs. The team denied this, but the intrigue surrounding a mystery jiffybag - a medical delivery to Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2011; the inconsistencies in Sky's explanations, and the absence of medical records at a team that was known for attention to detail and 'marginal gains' were further devastating blows. Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome was cleared of any wrongdoing in the case of his adverse analytical finding for salbutamol, but the saga did further damage to the team's standing. On the one hand, the timing is intriguing. Geraint Thomas' maiden Tour de France win was regarded as a timely PR boost after so much controversy.But there is more to come. In February, the the man at the very centre of the jiffybag scandal - ex Team Sky chief medic Dr Richard Freeman has a General Medical Council hearing when he will be asked to explain a mystery delivery of testosterone to the velodrome in 2011. Maybe Sky had simply had enough of the bad headlines, despite so many wins."
                    
                        
                
                
            Promising 21-year-old Colombian Egan Bernal, whose performance in this year's Tour de France marked him out as a potential Grand Tour contender, is also on the team."While Sky will be moving on at the end of next year, the team is open minded about the future and the potential of working with a new partner, should the right opportunity present itself," said team principal David Brailsford."We aren't finished yet by any means. There is another exciting year of racing ahead of us and we will be doing everything we can to deliver more Team Sky success in 2019."Team Sky's ambition to become the first team to win the Tour de France with a British rider was seen as hugely ambitious when they launched.Team Sky's Grand Tours record (best -placed rider)Giro D'ItaliaTour de FranceVuelta a Espana201017th - Dario Cioni16th - Thomas LofkvistDid not take part201120th - Thomas Lofkvist24th - Rigoberto Uran2nd - Chris Froome20127th - Rigoberto Uran1st - Bradley Wiggins4th - Chris Froome20132nd - Rigoberto Uran1st - Chris Froome27th - Rigoberto Uran201422nd - Sebastian Henao18th - Mikel Nieve2nd - Chris Froome20156th - Leopold Konig1st - Chris Froome8th - Mikel Nieve201617th - Sebastian Henao1st - Chris Froome2nd - Chris Froome201717th - Mikel Landa1st - Chris Froome1st - Chris Froome20181st - Chris Froome1st - Geraint Thomas15th - David de la CruzBut they have gone on to dominate the sport's most famous race, winning six of the past seven editions.However, the efficient but unspectacular style and big spending that has underpinned their stranglehold has proved unpopular with some fans, particularly in France.The team has also been subject to allegations of cheating.
