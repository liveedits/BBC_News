The jockey was cautioned by stewards at the course.Their report said: "The stewards enquired into the reason why ET Daly, rider, was jogging on the racing line in the back straight during the running of this race."Evidence was heard from the rider concerned who apologised for what had occurred."Having considered all the evidence, the stewards cautioned the rider to be more careful when out on the course in future."Daly, from County Galway, was the first jockey born in the 21st Century to ride a winner on an Irish racecourse when he triumphed aboard Roibeard at Fairyhouse in 2016.Jockeys often run around tracks before racing to lose weight and get an idea of the conditions, but it is thought Daly made a mistake over the race schedule.The two-mile Grade Three contest was won by Aramon, for trainer Willie Mullins.The Gordon Elliott-trained favourite Apple's Jade returned to action with victory in the Lismullen Hurdle but it was overshadowed for owners Gigginstown House Stud after Identity Thief suffered a fatal injury.Ballyoisin, trained by Enda Bolger, was an impressive winner of the Fortria Chase.
