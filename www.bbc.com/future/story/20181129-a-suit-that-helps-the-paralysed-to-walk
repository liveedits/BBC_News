                             Paralysis occurs when the brain's impulses to move can't reach the relevant muscles due to damage higher up the nervous system. But often some weaker signals are detectable with sophisticated sensors. A 'hybrid assistive limb' suit, or 'exoskeleton', can pick up those signals, and, with sophisticated robotics, help the limbs to move again. Scientists hope that with training this could help build the synaptic connections required for further rehabilitation.Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.
